      "content": "\n \nBHAGAVAN    VYASA,    the    celebrated \ncompiler  of  the  Vedas,  was  the  son  of  the  \ngreat  sage  Parasara.  It  was  he  who  gave  to  \nthe     world     the     divine     epic     of     the \nMahabharata.  \nHaving    conceived    the    Mahabharata    he \nthought  of  the  means  of  giving  the  sacred \nstory    to    the    world.    He    meditated    on \nBrahma,    the    Creator,    who    manifested \n\nhimself    before    him.    Vyasa    saluted    him \nwith   bowed   head   and   folded   hands   and \nprayed: \n\"Lord,    I    have    conceived    an    excellent \nwork,   but   cannot   think   of   one   who   can \ntake it down to my dictation.\" \nBrahma  extolled  Vyasa  and  said:  \"O  sage,  \ninvoke  Ganapati  and  beg  him  to  be  your \namanuensis.\"   Having   said   these   words   he \ndisappeared.  The  sage  Vyasa  meditated  on  \nGanapati  who  appeared  before  him.  Vyasa  \nreceived  him  with  due  respect  and  sought \nhis aid. \n\"Lord  Ganapati,  I  shall  dictate  the  story  of \nthe   Mahabharata   and   I   pray   you   to   be \ngraciously pleased to write it down.\" \nGanapati  replied:  \"Very  well.  I  shall  do  as  \nyou  wish.  But  my  pen  must  not  stop  while  \nI  am  writing.  So  you  must  dictate  without  \npause   or   hesitation.   I   can   only   write   on \nthis condition?\" \nVyasa   agreed,   guarding   himself,   however, \nwith   a   counter   stipulation:   \"Be   it   so,   but \nyou  must  first  grasp  the  meaning  of  what  I  \ndictate before you write it down.\" \nGanapati     smiled     and     agreed     to     the \ncondition.  Then  the  sage  began  to  sing  the  \nstory    of    the    Mahabharata.    He    would \noccasionally     compose     some     complex \nstanzas     which     would     make     Ganapati \npause  a  while  to  get  at  the  meaning  and \nVyasa   would   avail   himself   of   this   interval \nto   compose   many   stanzas   in   his   mind. \nThus  the  Mahabharata  came  to  be  written \nby Ganapati to the dictation of Vyasa.  \nIt  was  before  the  days  of  printing,  when \nthe   memory   of   the   learned   was   the   sole \nrepository  of  books.  Vyasa  first  taught  the  \ngreat  epic  to  his  son,  the  sage  Suka.  Later,  \nhe   expounded  it  to  many  other  disciples. \nWere  it  not  so,  the  book  might  have  been \nlost to future generations. \nTradition  has  it  that  Narada  told  the  story \nof   the   Mahabharata   to   the   devas   while \nSuka   taught   it   to   the   Gandharvas,   the \nRakshasas   and   the   Yakshas.   It   is   well \nknown    that    the    virtuous    and    learned \nVaisampayana,   one   of   the   chief   disciples \nof  Vyasa,  revealed  the  epic  for  the  benefit  \nof humanity.  \nJanamejaya,   the   son   of   the   great   King \nParikshit,   conducted   a   great   sacrifice   in \nthe     course     of     which     Vaisampayana \nnarrated   the   story   at   the   request   of   the \nformer.  Afterwards,  this  story,  as  told  by \nVaisampayana,  was  recited  by  Suta  in  the  \nforest  of  Naimisa  to  an  assembly  of  sages  \nunder the lead of the Rishi Saunaka. \nSuta   addressed   the   assembly:   \"I   had   the \ngood   fortune   to   hear   the   story   of   the \nMahabharata  composed  by  Vyasa  to  teach  \nhumanity   dharma   and   the   other   ends   of \nlife.  I  should  like  to  narrate  it  to  you.\"  At  \nthese  words  the  ascetics  eagerly  gathered \nround him. \nSuta  continued:  \"I  heard  the  main  story  of \nthe   Mahabharata   and   the   episodic   tales \ncontained  therein  told  by  Vaisampayana  at  \nthe      sacrifice      conducted      by      King \nJanamejaya.     Afterwards,     I     made     an \nextensive    pilgrimage    to    various    sacred \nplaces    and    also    visited    the    battlefield \nwhere   the   great   battle   described   in   the \nepic  was  fought.  I  have  now  come  here  to  \nmeet  you  all.\"  He  then  proceeded  to  tell \nthe  whole  story  of  the  Mahabharata  in  the  \ngrand assembly. \nAfter  the  death  of  the  great  King  Santanu,  \nChitrangada   became   King   of   Hastinapura \nand   he   was   succeeded   by   Vichitravirya. \nThe  latter  had  two  sons,  Dhritarashtra  and  \nPandu.  The  elder  of  the  two  being  born \nblind,     Pandu,     the     younger     brother, \nascended  the  throne.  In  the  course  of  his \nreign,   Pandu   committed   a   certain   offence \nand  had  to  resort  to  the  forest  with  his  two  \nwives    where    he    spent    many    years    in \npenance. \nDuring   their   stay   in   the   forest,   the   two \nwives   of   Pandu,   Kunti   and   Madri   gave \nbirth  to  five  sons  who  became  well  known  \nas  the  five  Pandavas.  Pandu  passed  away \n\nwhile   they   were   still   living   in   the   forest. \nThe   sages   brought up   the   five   Pandavas \nduring their early years.  \nWhen    Yudhishthira,    the    eldest,    attained \nthe  age  of  sixteen  the  rishis  led  them  all \nback  to  Hastinapura  and  entrusted  them  to  \nthe  old  grandsire  Bhishma.  In  a  short  time  \nthe   Pandavas   gained   mastery   over   the \nVedas  and  the  Vedanta  as  well  as  over  the  \nvarious   arts,   especially   pertaining   to   the \nKshatriyas.  The  Kauravas,  the  sons  of  the  \nblind  Dhritarashtra,  became  jealous  of  the \nPandavas    and    tried    to    injure    them    in \nvarious ways.  \nFinally   Bhishma,   the   head   of   the   family, \nintervened      to      bring      about      mutual \nunderstanding   and   peace   between   them. \nAccordingly     the     Pandavas     and     the \nKauravas   began   to   rule   separately   from \ntheir   respective   capitals,   Indraprastha   and \nHastinapura.  \nSome  time  later,  there  was  a  game  of  dice  \nbetween   the   Kauravas   and   the   Pandavas \naccording  to  the  then  prevailing  Kshatriya \ncode   of   honor.   Sakuni,   who   played   on \nbehalf      of      the      Kauravas,      defeated \nYudhishthira.   As   a   result,   the   Pandavas \nhad  to  be  in  exile  for  a  period  of  thirteen \nyears.  They  left  the  kingdom  and  went  to  \nthe     forest     with     their     devoted     wife \nDraupadi. \nAccording  to  the  conditions  of  the  game, \nthe   Pandavas   spent   twelve   years   in   the \nforest and the thirteenth year incognito.  \nWhen   they   returned   and   demanded   of \nDuryodhana    their    paternal    heritage,    the \nlatter,  who  had  in  the  meanwhile  usurped \ntheir   kingdom,   refused   to   return   it.   War \nfollowed as a consequence.  \nThe   Pandavas   defeated   Duryodhana   and \nregained   their   patrimony.   The   Pandavas \nruled    the    kingdom    for    thirty-six   years. \nAfterwards,  they  transferred  the  crown  to \ntheir   grandson,   Parikshit,   and   repaired   to \nthe  forest  with  Draupadi,  all  clad  humbly \nin barks of trees. \nThis  is  the  substance  of  the  story  of  the \nMahabharata.      In      this      ancient      and \nwonderful  epic  of  our  land  there  are  many \nillustrative    tales    and    sublime    teachings, \nbesides  the  narrative  of  the  fortunes  of  the  \nPandavas.  \nThe   Mahabharata   is   in   fact   a   veritable \nocean    containing    countless    pearls    and \ngems.   It   is,   with   the   Ramayana,   a   living \nfountain   of   the   ethics   and   culture   of   our \nMotherland. \n",

But   on   certain   conditions   that \nneither   you   nor   anyone   else   should   ever \nask  me  who  I  am,  or  whence  I  come.  You  \nmust    also    not    stand    in    the    way    of \nwhatever  I  do,  good  or  bad,  nor  must  you  \never   be   wroth   with   me   on   any   account \nwhatsoever.   You   must   not   say   anything \ndispleasing  to  me.  If  you  act  otherwise,  I \nshall   leave   you   then   and   there.   Do   you \nagree?\" \nThe  infatuated  king  vowed  his  assent,  and  \nshe became his wife and lived with him. \nThe  heart  of  the  king  was  captivated  by \nher  modesty  and  grace  and  the  steady  love  \nshe   bore   him.   King   Santanu   and   Ganga \nlived  a  life  of  perfect  happiness,  oblivious \nof the passage of time. \nShe   gave   birth   to   many   children;   each \nnewborn  babe  she  took  to  the  Ganges  and  \ncast  into  the  river,  and  then  returned  to  the  \nking with a smiling face.  \nSantanu     was     filled     with     horror     and \nanguish    at    such    fiendish    conduct,    but \nsuffered   it   all   in   silence,   mindful   of   the \npromise  be  had  made.  Often  he  wondered  \n\nwho   she   was,   wherefrom   she   had   come \nand  why  she  acted  like  a  murderous  witch.  \nStill   bound   by   his   word,   and   his   all-\nmastering  love  for  her,  he  uttered  no  word  \nof blame or remonstrance. \nThus  she  killed  seven  children.  When  the \neighth  child  was  born  and  she  was  about \nto  throw  it  into  the  Ganges,  Santanu  could  \nnot bear it any longer.  \nHe  cried:  \"Stop,  stop,  why  are  you  bent  on  \nthis   horrid   and   unnatural   murder   of   your \nown   innocent   babes?\"   With   this   outburst \nthe king restrained her. \n\"O   great   king,\"   she   replied,   \"you   have \nforgotten   your   promise,   for   your   heart   is \nset  on  your  child,  and  you  do  not  need  me  \nany  more.  I  go.  I  shall  not  kill  this  child, \nbut   listen   to   my   story   before   you   judge \nme.   I,   who   am   constrained   to   play   this \nhateful  role  by  the  curse  of  Vasishtha,  am \nthe   goddess  Ganga,  adored  of  gods  and \nmen.  Vasishtha  cursed  the  eight  Vasus  to \nbe  born  in  the  world  of  men,  and  moved  \nby   their   supplications   said,   I   was   to   be \ntheir  mother.  I  bore  them  to  you,  and  well  \nis  it  for  you  that  it  was  so.  For  you  will  go  \nto  higher  regions  for  this  service  you  have  \ndone  to  the  eight  Vasus.  I  shall  bring  up \nthis  last  child  of  yours  for  some  time  and \nthen return it to you as my gift.\"  \nAfter    saying    these    words    the    goddess \ndisappeared   with   the   child.   It   was   this \nchild     who     later     became     famous     as \nBhishma.   This   was   how   the   Vasus   came \nto  incur  Vasishtha's  curse.  They  went  for  a  \nholiday   with   their   wives   to   a   mountain \ntract     where     stood     the     hermitage     of \nVasishtha:   One   of   them   saw   Vasishtha's \ncow, Nandini, grazing there.  \nIts   divinely   beautiful   form   attracted   him \nand  he  pointed  it  out  to  the  ladies.  They \nwere   all   loud   in   praise   of   the   graceful \nanimal,   and   one   of   them      requested   her \nhusband to secure it for her. \nHe   replied:   \"What   need   have   we,   the \ndevas,   for   the   milk   of   cows?   This   cow \nbelongs  to  the  sage  Vasishtha  who  is  the \nmaster    of    the    whole    place.    Man    will \ncertainly   become   immortal   by   drinking   its \nmilk.  But  this  is  no  gain  to  us,  who  are \nalready   immortal.   Is   it   worth   our   while \nincurring     Vasishtha's     wrath     merely     to \nsatisfy a whim?\" \nBut  she  was  not  thus  to  be  put  off.  \"I  have  \na  dear  companion  in  the  mortal  world.  It  is  \nfor   her   sake   that   I   make   this   request. \nBefore   Vasishtha   returns   we   shall   have \nescaped  with  the  cow.  You  must  certainly \ndo  this  for  my  sake,  for  it  is  my  dearest \nwish.\"    Finally    her    husband   yielded.   All \nthe   Vasus   joined   together   and   took   the \ncow and its calf away with them.  \nWhen   Vasishtha   returned   to   his   ashrama, \nhe  missed  the  cow  and  the  calf,  because \nthey    were    indispensable    for    his    daily \nrituals. \nVery  soon  he  came  to  know  by  his  yogic  \ninsight   all   that   had   taken   place.   Anger \nseized  him  and  he  uttered  a  curse  against \nthe   Vasus.   The   sage,   whose   sole   wealth \nwas   his   austerity,   willed   that   they   should \nbe  born  into  the  world  of  men.  When  the  \nVasus    came    to    know    of    the    curse, \nrepentant   too   late, they   threw   themselves \non     the     sage's     mercy     and     implored \nforgiveness. \nVasishtha   said:   \"The   curse   must   needs \ntake  its  course.  Prabhasa,  the  Vasu  who \nseized  the  cow,  will  live  long  in  the  world  \nin   all   glory,   but   the   others   will   be   freed \nfrom  the  curse  as  soon  as  born.  My  words  \ncannot  prove  ineffective,  but  I  shall  soften \nthe curse to this extent.\"  \nAfterwards,   Vasishtha   set   his   mind   again \non  his  austerities,  the  effect  of  which  had \nbeen  slightly  impaired  by  his  anger.  Sages \nwho  perform  austerities  acquire  the  power \nto  curse,  but  every  exercise  of  this  power  \nreduces their store of merit.  \nThe   Vasus   felt   relieved   and   approached \nthe   goddess   Ganga   and   begged   of   her: \n\"We  pray  you  to  become  our  mother.  For  \n\nour  sake  we  beseech  you  to  descend  to  the  \nearth  and  marry  a  worthy  man.  Throw  us  \ninto  the  water  as  soon  as  we  are  born  and  \nliberate  us  from  the  curse.\"  The  goddess \ngranted  their  prayer,  came  to  the  earth  and  \nbecame the wife of Santanu. \nWhen  the  goddess  Ganga  left  Santanu  and  \ndisappeared  with  the  eighth  child,  the  king \ngave  up  all  sensual  pleasures  and  ruled  the  \nkingdom  in  a  spirit  of  asceticism.  One  day \nhe  was  wandering  along  the  banks  of  the \nGanges  when  he  saw  a  boy  endowed  with  \nthe  beauty  and  form  of  Devendra,  the  king  \nof the gods.  \nThe  child  was  amusing  himself  by casting \na   dam   of   arrows   across   the   Ganges   in \nflood,   playing   with   the   mighty   river   as   a \nchild   with   an   indulgent   mother.   To   the \nking       who       stood       transfixed       with \namazement    at    the    sight,    the    goddess \nGanga  revealed  herself  and  presented  the \nchild as his own son. \nShe  said:  \"O  king,  this  is  that  eighth  child  \nI  bore  you.  I  have  brought  him  up  till  now.  \nHis    name  is  Devavrata.  He  has  mastered  \nthe  art  of  arms  and  equals  Parasurama  in \nprowess.  He  has  learnt  the  Vedas  and  the  \nVedanta    from    Vasishtha,    and    is    well \nversed  in  the  arts  and  sciences  known  to \nSukra.  Take  back  with  you  this  child  who  \nis  a  great  archer  and  hero  as  well  as  a \nmaster in statecraft.\" \nThen  she  blessed  the  boy,  handed  him  to \nhis father, the king, and disappeared. \n",

One  day  as  the  king \nwas    wandering    on    the    banks    of    the \nYamuna,   the   air   was   suddenly   filled   with \na  fragrance  so  divinely  sweet  that  the  king \nsought  for  its  cause,  and  he  traced  it  to  a  \nmaiden    so    lovely    that    she    seemed    a \ngoddess.  A  sage  had  conferred  on  her  the  \nboon     that     a     divine     perfume     should \nemanate    from    her,    and    this    was    now \npervading the whole forest. \nFrom  the  moment  the  goddess  Ganga  left \nhim,   the   king   had   kept   his   senses   under \ncontrol,    but    the    sight    of    this    divinely \nbeautiful    maiden    burst    the    bonds    of \nrestraint      and      filled      him      with      an \novermastering  desire.  He  asked  her  to  be \nhis wife.  \nThe   maiden   said:   \"I   am   a   fisherwoman, \nthe  daughter  of  the  chief  of  the  fishermen.  \nMay  it  please  you  to  ask  him  and  get  his  \nconsent.\"   Her   voice   was   sweet   as   her \nform. \nThe father was an astute man.  \nHe  said:  \"O  king,  there  is  no  doubt  that \nthis   maiden,   like   every   other,   has   to   be \nmarried   to   someone   and   you   are   indeed \nworthy  of  her.  Still  you  have  to  make  a \npromise to me before you can have her.\" \nSantanu  replied:  \"If  it  is  a  just  promise  I \nshall make it.\" \nThe  chief  of  the  fisherfolk  said:  \"The  child  \nborn   of   this   maiden   should   be   the   king \nafter you.\"  \nThough  almost  mad  with  passion,  the  king \ncould  not  make  this  promise,  as  it  meant \nsetting   aside   the   godlike   Devavrata,   the \nson   of   Ganga,   who   was   entitled   to   the \ncrown.  \nIt  was  a  price  that  could  not  be  thought  of  \nwithout   shame.   He   therefore   returned   to \nhis   capital,   Hastinapura,   sick   with   baffled \ndesire.   He   did   not   reveal   the   matter   to \nanyone and languished in silence. \nOne  day  Devavrata  asked  his  father:  \"My \nfather,  you  have  all  that  your  heart  could \nwish.  Why  then  are  you  so  unhappy?  How \nis  it  that  you  are  like  one  pining  away  with  \na secret sorrow?\" \nThe  king  replied:  \"Dear  son,  what  you  say \nis  true.  I  am  indeed  tortured  with  mental \npain   and   anxiety.   You   are   my   only   son \nand    you    are    always    preoccupied    with \nmilitary   ambitions.   Life   in   the   world   is \n\nuncertain    and    wars    are    incessant.    If \nanything   untoward   befalls   you   our   family \nwill   become   extinct.   Of   course,   you   are \nequal  to  a  hundred  sons.  Still,  those  who \nare  well  read  in  the  scriptures  say  that  in \nthis  transitory  world  having  but  one  son  is  \nthe  same  as  having  no  son  at  all.  It  is,  not  \nproper  that  the  perpetuation  of  our  family \nshould  depends  on  a  single  life,  and  above  \nall  things  I  desire  the  perpetuation  of  our \nfamily.   This   is   the   cause   of   my   anguish.\" \nThe  father  prevaricated,  being  ashamed  to \nreveal the whole story to his son.  \nThewise    Devavrata    realised    that    there \nmust   be   a   secret   cause   for   the   mental \ncondition   of   his   father,   and   questioning \nthe  king's  charioteer  came  to  know  of  his  \nmeeting    with    the    fishermaiden    on    the \nbanks   of   the   Yamuna.   He   went   to   the \nchief   of   the   fishermen   and   besought   his \ndaughter's hand on his father's behalf. \nThe   fisherman   was   respectful,   but   firm: \n\"My  daughter  is  indeed  fit  to  be  the  king's  \nspouse.  Then  should  not  her  son  become \nking?  But  you  have  been  crowned  as  the \nheir   apparent   and   will   naturally   succeed \nyour   father.   It   is   this   that   stands   in   the \nway.\" \nDevavrata   replied:   \"I   give   you   my   word \nthat  the  son  born  of  this  maiden  shall  be \nking.  And  I  renounce  in  his  favor  my  right  \nas  heir  apparent,\"  and  he  took  a  vow  to \nthat effect. \nThe  chief  of  the  fishermen  said:  \"O  best  of  \nthe  Bharata  race,  you  have  done  what  no  \none  else  born  of  royal  blood  has  you  have  \ndone  till  now.  You  are  indeed  a  hero.  You  \ncan   yourself   conduct   my   daughter   to   the \nking,  your  father.  Still,  hear  with  patience \nthese  words  of  mine  which  I  say  as  the \nfather of the girl. \n\"I  have  no  doubt  you  will  keep  your  word,  \nbut  how  can  I  hope  that  the  children  born \nof    you    will    renounce    their    birthright? \nYour  sons  will  naturally  be  mighty  heroes \nlike  you,  and  will  be  hard  to  resist  if  they  \nseek  to  seize  the  kingdom  by  force.  This  is  \nthe doubt that torments me.\" \nWhen  he  heard  this  knotty  question  posed  \nby   the   girl's   father,   Devavrata,   who   was \nbent   on   fulfilling   the   king's   desire,   made \nhis  supreme  renunciation.  He  vowed  with \nupraised  arm  to  the  father  of  the  maiden: \n\"I  shall  never  marry  and  I  dedicate  myself \nto a life of unbroken chastity.\"  \nAnd    as    he    uttered    these    words    of \nrenunciation   the   gods   showered   flowers \non    his    head,    and    cries    of    \"Bhishma,\" \n\"Bhishma\"       resounded       in       the      air. \n\"Bhishma\"   means   one   who   undertakes   a \nterrible    vow    and    fulfils    it.    That    name \nbecame      the      celebrated      epithet      of \nDevavrata  from  that  time.  Then  the  son  of \nGanga   led   the   maiden   Satyavati   to   his \nfather. \nTwo    sons    were    born    of    Satyavati    to \nSantanu,    Chitrangada    and    Vichitravirya, \nwho   ascended   the   throne   one   after   the \nother.      Vichitravirya      had      two      sons, \nDhritarashtra         and         Pandu,         born \nrespectively   of   his   two   queens,   Ambika \nand Ambalika.  \nThe   sons   of   Dhritarashtra,   a   hundred   in \nnumber,   were   known   as   the   Kauravas. \nPandu  had  five  sons  who  became  famous \nas    the    Pandavas.    Bhishma    lived    long, \nhonored   by   all   as   the   grandsire   until   the \nend of the famous battle of Kurukshetra.  \nThe Family Tree \n                                                      \nSantanu \n                                     (by    Ganga)       \n(by Satyavati) \nBhishma \n Chitrangada&Vichitravirya \n  (by Ambika)      (by Ambalika) \n                                                  \nDhtitarashtra    Pandu \n                                            ?   \n        ? \n  The  Kauravas    The Pandavas \n",

As  \nhe       died       childless,       his       brother, \nVichitravirya,    was    the    rightful    heir    and \nwas  duly  crowned  king.  And  as  he  was  a  \nminor,   Bhishma   governed   the   kingdom   in \nhis name till be came of age. \nWhen   Vichitravirya   reached   adolescence \nBhishma   cast   about   for   a   bride   for   him. \nAnd  as  he  heard  that  the  daughters  of  the  \nking  of  Kasi  were  to  choose  theirhusbands  \naccording     to     the     ancient     Kshatriya \npractice  he  went  there  to  secure  them  for  \nhis brother.  \nThe    rulers    of    Kosla,    Vanga,    Pundra, \nKalinga   and   other   princes   and   potentates \nhad    also    repaired    to    Kasi    for    the \nswayamvara,    attired    in    their    best.    The \nprincesses   were   so   far-famed   for   beauty \nand  accomplishments  that  there  was  fierce  \ncompetition to win them. \nBhishma      was      famous      among      the \nKshatriyas   as   a   mighty   man-at-arms.   At \nfirst  everyone  thought  that  the  redoubtable \nhero   had   come   merely   to   witness   the \nfestivities   of   the   swayamvara.   But   when \nthey  found  that  he  was  also  a  suitor,  the \nyoung   princes   felt   themselves   let   down \nand   were   full   of   chagrin.   They   did   not \nknow  that  he  had  really  come  for  the  sake  \nof his brother, Vichitravirya. \nThe   princes   began   to   cast   affronts   at \nBhishma:   \"This   most   excellent   and   wise \ndescendant  of  the  Bharata  race  forgets  that  \nhe  is  too  old  and  forgets  also  his  vow  of \ncelibacy.  What  has  this  old  man  to  do  with  \nthis    swayamvara?    Fie    on    him!\"    The \nprincesses    who    were    to    choose    their \nhusbands   barely   glanced   at   the   old   man \nand looked away.   \nBhishma's       wrath       flamed       up.       He \nchallenged  the  assembled  princes  to  a  trial \nof   their   manhood   and   defeated   them   all. \nAnd   taking   the   three   princesses   in   his \nchariot he set out for Hastinapura.  \nBut   before   he   had   gone   far,   Salva,   the \nking   of   the   Saubala   country   who   was \nattached     to     Amba,     intercepted     and \nopposed    him.    For    that    princess    had \nmentally   chosen   Salva   as   her   husband. \nAfter  a  bitter  fight  Salva  was  worsted,  and  \nno   wonder,   as   Bhishma   was   a   peerless \nbowman.    But    at    the    request    of    the \nprincesses Bhishma spared his life.  \nArriving      in      Hastinapura      with      the \nprincesses,    Bhishma    made    preparations \nfor   their   marriage   to   Vichitravirya.   When \nall    were    assembled    for    the    marriage, \nAmba   smiled   mockingly   at   Bhishma   and \naddressed    him    as    follows:    \"O    son    of \nGanga,  you  are  aware  of  what  is  enjoined  \nin   the   scriptures.   I   have   mentally   chosen \nSalva,    the    king    of    Saubala,    as    my \nhusband.   You   have   brought   me   here   by \nforce.  Knowing  this,  do  what  you,  learned  \nin the scriptures, should do.\"  \nBhishma     admitted     the     force     of     her \nobjection    and    sent    her    to    Salva    with \nproper   escort.   The   marriage   of   Ambika \nand   Ambalika,   the   two   younger   sisters, \nwith Vichitravirya was duly solemnised. \nAmba   went   rejoicing   to   Salva   and   told \nhim  what  had  happened:  \"I  have  mentally \nchosen  you  as  my  husband  from  the  very \nstart. Bhishma  has  sent  me  to  you.  Marry \nme according to the sastras.\"  \nSalva   replied:   \"Bhishma   defeated   me   in \nsight  of  all,  and  carried  you  away.  I  have  \nbeen  disgraced.  So,  I  cannot  receive  you \nnow  as  my  wife.  Return  to  him  and  do  as  \nhe   commands.\"   With   these   words   Salva \nsent her back to Bhishma. \nShe    returned    to    Hastinapura    and    told \nBhishma   of   what   had   taken   place.   The \ngrandsire   tried   to   induce   Vichitravirya   to \nmarry     her.     But     Vichitravirya     roundly \nrefused   to   marry   a   maiden   whose   heart \nhad already been given to another. \nAmba   then   turned   to   Bhishma   and   she \nsought  him  to  marry  her  himself  as  there \nwas  no  other  recourse.  It  was  impossible \n\nfor  Bhishma  to  break  his  vow,  sorry  as  he  \nwas    for    Amba.    And    after    some    vain \nattempts  to  make  Vichitravirya  change  his \nmind,  he  told  her  there  was  no  way  left  to  \nher  but  to  go  again  to  Salva  and  seek  to  \npersuade him.  \nThis  at  first  she  was  too  proud  to  do,  and  \nfor  long  years  she  abode  in  Hastinapura. \nFinally,  in  sheer  desperation,  she  went  to \nSalva and found him adamant in refusal. \nThe lotus-eyed    Amba    spent    six    bitter \nyears  in  sorrow  and  baffled  hope.  And  her  \nheart  was  seared  with  suffering  and  all  the  \nsweetness  in  her  turned  to  gall  and  fierce \nhatred   towards   Bhishma   as   the   cause   of \nher blighted life.  \nShe  sought  in  vain  for  a  champion  among \nthe  princes  to  fight  and  kill  Bhishma  and \nthus   avenge   her   wrongs   but   even   the \nforemost  warriors  were  afraid  of  Bhishma \nand paid no heed to her appeal.  \nAt  last,  she  resorted  to  hard  austerities  to  \nget   the   grace   of   Lord   Subrahmanya.   He \ngraciously   appeared   before   her   and   gave \nher  a  garland  of  ever-fresh  lotuses,  saying \nthat   the   wearer   of   that   garland   would \nbecome the enemy of Bhishma. \nAmba   took   the   garland   and   again   be \nsought    every    Kshatriya    to    accept    the \ngarland  gift  of  the  six-faced  Lord  and  to \nchampion  her  cause.  But  no  one  had  the \nhardihood to antagonise Bhishma.  \nFinally,   she   went   to   King   Drupada   who \nalso  refused  to  grant  her  prayer.  She  then \nhung  the  garland  at  Drupada's  palace  gate  \nand    went    away    to    the    forest.    Some \nascetics  whom  she  met  there  and  to whom \nshe  told  her  sorrowful  tale  advised  her  to \ngo   to   Parasurama   as   a   suppliant.   She \nfollowed their advice. \nOn  hearing  her  sad  story,  Parasurama  was  \nmoved   with   compassion   and   said:   \"Dear \nchild,  what  do  you  want?  I  can  ask  Salva  \nto marry you if you wish it.\" \nAmba  said:  \"No,  I  do  not  wish  it.  I  no \nlonger     desire     marriage     or     home     or \nhappiness.  There  is  now  but  one  thing  in \nlife  for  me,  revenge  on  Bhishma.  The  only \nboon I seek is the death of Bhishma.\" \nParasurama    moved    as    much    by    her \nanguish   as   by   his   abiding hatred   of   the \nKshatriya   race,   espoused   her   cause   and \nfought   with   Bhishma.   It   was   a   long   and \nequal   combat   between   the   two   greatest \nmen-at-arms   of   the   age.   But   in   the   end \nParasurama   had   to   acknowledge   defeat. \nHe   told   Amba:   \"I   have   done   all   that   I \ncould   and   I   have   failed.   Throw   yourself \non  the  mercy  of  Bhishma.  That  is  the  only \ncourse left to you.\"  \nConsumed  with  grief  and  rage,  and  kept \nalive   only   by   the   passion   for   revenge, \nAmba     went     to     the     Himalayas     and \npractised   rigorous   austerities   to   get   the \ngrace  of  Siva,  now  that  all  human  aid  had  \nfailed  her.  Siva  appeared  before  her  and \ngranted  her  a  boon,  that  in  her  next  birth \nshe would slay Bhishma. \nAmba  was  impatient  for  that  rebirth  which \nwould  give  her  heart's  desire.  She  made  a  \npyre  and  plunged  into  the  fire  pouring  out  \nthe   flame   in   her   heart   into   the   scarcely \nhotter blaze of the pyre. \nBy   the   grace   of   Lord   Siva,   Amba   was \nborn  as  the  daughter  of  King  Drupada.  A \nfew   years   after   her   birth,   she   saw   the \ngarland   of   never-fading   flowers   that   still \nhung  at  the  palace  gate  and  had  remained  \nthere   untouched   by   anyone   through   fear. \nShe   put   it   round   her   neck.   Her   father \nDrupada    was    in    consternation    at    her \ntemerity  which  he  feared  would  draw  on \nhis head the wrath of Bhishma. \nHe   sent   his   daughter   in   exile   out   of   the \ncapital     to     the     forest.     She     practised \nausterities   in   the   forest   and   in   time   was \ntransformed    into    a    male    and    became \nknown as the warrior Sikhandin.  \nWith   Sikhandin   as   his   charioteer,   Arjuna \nattacked    Bhishma    on    the    battlefield    of \nKurukshetra.        Bhishma        knew        that \nSikhandin was  born  as  female,  and  true  to  \n\nhis   code   of   chivalry   he   would   not   fight \nhim under any circumstance.  \nSo  it  was  that  Arjuna  could  fight  screened  \nby     Sikhandin     and     conquer     Bhishma, \nespecially  because  Bhishma  knew  that  his \nlong   and   weary   probation   on   earth   was \nfinished and consented to be vanquished.  \nAs  the  arrows  struck  Bhishma  in  his  last \nfight,    he    singled    out    those    which    had \npierced   him   deepest   and   said:   \"This   is \nArjuna's   arrow   and   not   Sikhandin's.\"   So \nfell this great warrior.  \n",

Both   belligerents   had \nillustrious   preceptors.   Brihaspati   who   was \npre-eminent    in    the    knowledge    of    the \nVedas  was  the  guiding  spirit  of  the  devas,  \nwhile   the   asuras   relied   on   Sukracharya's \nprofound wisdom.  \nThe   asuras   had   the   formidable   advantage \nthat    Sukracharya    alone    possessed    the \nsecret   of   Sanjivini   which   could   recall   the \ndead   to   life.   Thus   the   asuras   who   had \nfallen  in  the  battle  were  brought  back  to \nlife,   time   and   again,   and   continued   their \nfight  with  the  devas.  The  devas  were  thus  \nat    a    great    disadvantage    in    their    long \ndrawn-out war with their natural foes. \nThey     went     to     Kacha,     the     son     of \nBrihaspati,   and   besought   his   aid.   They \nbegged  him  to  win  his  way  into  the  good  \ngraces   of   Sukracharya   and   persuade   him \nto  take  him  as  a  pupil.  Once  admitted  to \nintimacy    and    confidence,    he    was    to \nacquire,  by  fair  means  or  foul,  the  secret \nof     Sanjivini     and     remove     the     great \nhandicap under which the devas suffered.  \nKacha  acceded  to  their  request  and  set  out  \nto   meet   Sukracharya   who   lived   in   the \ncapital  city  of  Vrishaparva,  the  king  of  the  \nasuras.  Kacha  went  to  the  house  of  Sukra,  \nand   after   due   salutation,   addressed   him \nthus:   \"I   am   Kacha,   the   grandson   of   the \nsage  Angiras  and  the  son  of  Brihaspati.  I \nam    a    brahmacharin    seeking    knowledge \nunder your tutelage.\"  \nIt  was  the  law  that  the  wise  teacher  should  \nnot   refuse   a   worthy   pupil   who   sought \nknowledge  of  him.  So  Sukra  acceded  and  \nsaid:    \"Kacha,    you    belong    to    a    good \nfamily.  I  accept  you  as  my  pupil,  the  more  \nwillingly,  that  by  doing  so  I  shall  also  be \nshowing my respect for Brihaspati.\"  \nKacha       spent       many       years       under \nSukracharya,   rendering   to   perfection   the \nprescribed   duties   in   the   household   of   his \nmaster.  Sukracharya  had  a  lovelydaughter, \nDevayani,    of    whom    he    was    extremely \nfond.   Kacha   devoted   himself   to   pleasing \nand  serving  her  with  song  and  dance  and \npastime    and    succeeded    in    winning    her \naffection,    without    detriment    however    to \nthe vows of brahmacharya. \nWhen   the   asuras   came   to   know   of   this, \nthey   became   anxious   as   they   suspected \nthat    Kacha's    object    was    somehow    to \nwheedle  out  of  Sukracharya  the  secret  of \nSanjivini.      They      naturally      sought      to \nprevent such a calamity. \nOne    day,    as    Kacha    was    engaged    in \ngrazing  the  cattle  of  his  master  the  asuras  \nseized  him,  tore  him  to  pieces  and  cast  his  \nflesh  to  the  dogs.  When  the  cattle  returned  \nwithout   Kacha,   Devayani   was   filled   with \nanxiety,   and   ran   to   her   father   with   loud \nlamentations:    \"The    sun    has    set,\"    she \nwailed,  \"and  your  nightly  fire  sacrifice  has  \nbeen    performed;    still    Kacha    has    not \nreturned  home.  The  cattle  have  come  back  \nby   themselves.   I   fear   some   mishap   has \nbefallen    Kacha.    I    cannot    live    without \nhim.\" \nThe    fond    father    employed    the    art    of \nSanjivini   and   invoked   the   dead   youth   to \nappear.  At  once  Kacha  came  back  to  life  \nand  greeted  the  master  with  smiles.  Asked  \nby  Devayani  the  reason  for  his  delay,  he \ntold  her  that  as  he  was  grazing  the  cattle \nthe  asuras  came  suddenly  on  him  and  slew  \n\nhim.  How  he  came  back  to  life  he  knew \nnot,   but   come   back   to   life   he   did,   and \nthere he was.  \nOn   another   occasion   Kacha   went   to   the \nforest  to  pluck  flowers  for  Devayani,  and \nagain   the   asuras   seized   and   killed   him, \nand  pounding  his  body  to  a  paste,  mixed  it  \nup  in  sea-water.  As  he  did  not  return  even  \nafter  a  long time  Devayani  went  as  before  \nto  her  father  who  brought  Kacha  back  to  \nlife   by   his   Sanjivini,   and   heard   from   him \nall that had taken place.  \nFor  the  third  time  again,  the  Asuras  killed  \nKacha  and  very  cleverly  as  they  thought, \nburnt   his   body,   mixed   the   ashes   in  wine \nand  served  it  to  Sukracharya  who  drank  it,  \nsuspecting   nothing.   Once   more   the   cows \nreturned   home   without   their   keeper,   and \nonce    again    Devayani    approached    her \nfather    with    her    distressful    appeal    for \nKacha. \nSukracharya   tried   in   vain   to   console   his \ndaughter.  \"Though  I  have  again  and  again \nbrought  back  Kacha  to  life,\"  said  he,  \"the  \nasuras   seem   bent   upon   killing   him.   Well, \ndeath   is   the   common   lot,   and   it   is   not \nproper  for  a  wise  soul  like  you  to  sorrow \nat  it.  Your  life  is  all  before  you  to  enjoy,  \nwith  youth  and  beauty  and  the  goodwill  of \nthe world.\"  \nDevayani   deeply   loved   Kacha,   and   since \nthe  world  began,  wise  words  have  never \ncured  the  ache  of  bereavement.  She  said: \n\"Kacha,  the  grandson  of  Angiras  and  the \nson   of   Brihaspati,   was   a   blameless   boy, \nwho    was    devoted    and    tireless    in    our \nservice.  I  loved  him  dearly,  and  now  that \nhe  has  been  killed,  life  to  me  has  become  \nbleak   and   insupportable.   I   shall   therefore \nfollow   in   his   path.\"   And   Devayani   began \nto  fast.  Sukracharya,  heart-stricken  by  his  \ndaughter's    sorrow,    became    very    angry \nwith  the  asuras,  and  felt  that  the  heinous \nsin   of   killing   a   brahmana   would   weigh \nheavily on their fortunes.  \nHe  employed  the  Sanjivini  art  and  called \nupon  Kacha  to  appear.  By  the  power  of \nthe  Sanjivini  Kacha  dispersed  as  he  was  in  \nthe   wine which   was   inside   Sukracharya's \nbody    at    the    time,    regained    life,    but \nprevented     by     the     peculiarity     of     his \nlocation   from   coming   out,   he   could   only \nanswer to his name from where he was. \nSukracharya        exclaimed        in        angry \namazement:    \"O    brahmacharin,    how    did \nyou  get  into  me?  Is  this  also  the  work  of \nthe   asuras?   This   is   really   too   bad   and \nmakes    me    feel    like    killing    the    asuras \nimmediately   and   joining   the   devas.   But \ntell me the whole story.\"  \nKacha   narrated   it   all,   in   spite   of   the \ninconvenience imposed by his position. \nVaisampayana      continued:      \"The      high-\nsouled     and     austere     Sukracharya     of \nimmeasurable   greatness,   became   angry   at \nthe   deceit   practised   on   him   in   his   wine, \nand     proclaimed     for     the     benefit     of \nhumanity:  'Virtue  will  desert  the  man  who \nthrough   lack   of   wisdom   drinks   wine.  He \nwill  be  an  object  of  scorn  to  all,  This  is \nmy  message  to  humanity,  which  should  be  \nregarded     as     an     imperative     scriptural \ninjunction.'  Then  he  turned  to  his  daughter  \nDevayani  and  said:  Dear  daughter,  here  is  \na  problem  for  you.  For  Kacha  to  live,  he  \nmust  rend  my  stomach  and  come  out  of  it,  \nand  that  means  death  to  me.  His  life  can \nonly be bought by my death.\"  \nDevayani  began  to  weep  and  said:  \"Alas! \nIt  is  death  to  me  either  way.  For  if  either  \nof    you    perish,    I    shall    not    survive.\" \nSukracharya   sought   a   way   out   of   the \ndifficulty.   The   real   explanation   of   it   all \nflashed on him.  \nHe  said  to  Kacha:  \"O  son  of  Brihaspati,  I  \nnow  see  with  what  object  you  came  and \nverily   you   have   secured   it!   I   must   bring \nyou  out  to  life  for  the  sake  of  Devayani, \nbut   equally   for   her   sake   I   must   not   die \neither.  The  only  way  is  to  initiate  you  in \nthe  art  of  Sanjivini  so  that  you  can  bring \n\nme   back   to   life   after   I   shall   have   died \nwhen    a    way    is    torn    out    through    my \nentrails   for   you.   You   should   employ   the \nknowledge   I   am   going   to   impart   to   you \nand  revive  me,  so  that  Devayani  need  not  \ngrieve for either of us.\"  \nAccordingly  Sukracharya  imparted  the  art \nof  Sanjivini  to  Kacha.  Immediately  Kacha \ncame    forth    from    Sukracharya's    body, \nemerging  like  the  full  moon  from  a  cloud, \nwhile    the    great    preceptor    fell    down \nmangled and dead. \nBut   Kacha   at   once   brought   Sukracharya \nback    to    life    by    means    of    his    newly \nacquired  Sanjivini.  Kacha  bowed  down  to  \nSukracharya   and   said:   \"The   teacher   who \nimparts  wisdom  to  the  ignorant  is  a  father.  \nBesides,  as  I  have  issued  from  your  body  \nyou are my mother too.\" \nKacha   remained   for   many   more   years \nunder   the   tutelage   of   Sukracharya.   When \nthe  period  of  his  vow  ended,  he  took  leave  \nof  his  master  to  return  to  the  world  of  the  \ngods. \nAs   he   was   about   to   depart   Devayani \nhumbly      addressed      him thus:      \"O, \ngrandchild  of  Angiras,  you  have  won  my \nheart   by   your   blameless   life,   your   great \nattainments   and   nobility   of   birth.   I   have \nloved   you   long   and   tenderly,   even   while \nyou   were   faithfully   following   your   vows \nof    a    brahmacharin.    You    should    now \nreciprocate  my  love  and  make  me  happy \nby   marrying   me.   Brihaspati   as   well   as \nyourself  are  fully  worthy  of  being  honored  \nby me. \" \nIn  those  days,  it  was  no  uncommon  thing \nfor   wise   and   learned   brahmana   ladies   to \nspeak    out    their    mind    with    honorable \nfrankness. But Kacha said:  \n\"O   faultless   one,   you   are   my   master's \ndaughter  and  ever  worthy  of  my  respect.  I  \ngot  back  my  life  by  being  born  out  of  your  \nfather's  body.  Hence  I  am  your  brother.  It  \nis  not  proper  for  you,  my  sister,  to  ask  me  \nto wed you.\" \nDevayani  sought  in  vain  to persuade  him.  \n\"You  are  the  son  of  Brihaspati,\"  said  she,  \n\"and  not  of  my  father.  If  I  have  been  the  \ncause  of  your  coming  back  to  life,  it  was  \nbecause   I   loved   you   as   indeed   I   have \nalways  loved  you  as  my  husband.  It  is  not  \nfit   that   you   should   give   up   one   like   me \nsinless and devoted to you.\" \nKacha  replied:  \"Do  not  seek  to  persuade \nme      to      unrighteousness.      You      are \nenchanting    more    so    now    than    ever, \nflushed  as  you  are  with  anger.  But  I  am \nyour   brother.   Pray   bid   me   adieu.   Serve \nunto    perfection,    ever    and    always,    my \nmaster Sukracharya.\"  \nWith      these      words      Kacha      gently \ndisengaged   himself   and   proceeded   to   the \nabode    of    Indra,    the    king    of    gods. \nSukracharya consoled his daughter. \n",

      "content": "\nONE    warm    afternoon,    pleasantly    tired \nwith  sporting  in  the  woods  Devayani  and \nthe  daughters  of  Vrishaparva,  king  of  the \nasuras,  went  to  bathe  in  the  cool  waters  of  \na  sylvan  pool,  depositing  their  garlands  on \nthe bank before they entered its waters.  \nA     strong     breeze     blew     their     clothes \ntogether   into   a   huddled   heap   and   when \nthey   came   to   take   them   up   again,   some \nmistakes      naturally      occurred.      It      so \nhappened    that    princess    Sarmishtha,    the \ndaughter    of    the    king,    clad    herself    in \nDevayani's   clothes.   The   latter   was   vexed \nand     exclaimed     half     in     jest     at     the \nimpropriety   of   the   daughter   of   a   disciple \nwearing     the     clothes     of     the     master's \ndaughter. \nThese  words  were  spoken  half  in  jest,  but  \nthe    princess    Sarmishtha    became    very \nangry   and   said   arrogantly:   \"Do   you   not \nknow   that   your   father   humbly   bows   in \nreverence   to   my   royal   father   every   day? \nAre  you  not  the  daughter  of  a  beggar  who  \nlives  on  my  father's  bounty?  You  forget  I \nam  of  the  royal  race  which  proudly  gives,  \nwhile  you  come  of  a  race  which  begs  and  \n\nreceives,  and  you  dare  to  speak  thus  to \nme.\"  \nSarmishtha   went   on,   getting   angrier   and \nangrier   as   she   spoke   till,   working   herself \nup  into  a  fit  of  anger,  she  finally  slapped \nDevayani   on   the   cheek   and   pushed   her \ninto    a    dry    well.    The    asura    maidens \nthought  that  Devayani  had  lost  her  life  and  \nreturned to the palace. \nDevayani   had   not   been   killed   by   the   fall \ninto   the   well   but   was   in   a   sad   plight \nbecause  she  could  not  climb  up  the  steep  \nsides.  Emperor  Yayati  of  the  Bharata  race  \nwho  was  hunting  in  the  forest  by  a  happy \nchance   came   to   this   spot   in   search   of \nwater  to  slake  his  thirst.  When  he  glanced  \ninto   the   well,   he   saw   something   bright, \nand   looking   closer,   he   was   surprised   to \nfind a beautiful maiden lying in the well.  \nHe   asked:   \"Who   are   you,   O   beautiful \nmaiden    with    bright    earrings    and    ruddy \nnails?  Who  is  your  father?  What  is  your \nancestry?  How  did  you  fall  into  the  well?\"    \nShe    replied:    \"I    am    the    daughter    of \nSukracharya.   He   does   not   know   that   I \nhave  fallen  into  the  well.  Lift  me  up\"  and \nshe  held  forth  her  hands.  Yayati  seized  her  \nhand and helped her out of the well. \nDevayani   did   not   wish   to   return   to   the \ncapital  of  the  king  of  the  asuras.  She  did \nnot    feel    it    safe    to    go    there,    as    she \npondered  again  and  again  on  Sarmishtha's \nconduct.  She  told  Yayati:  \"You  have  held \na  maiden  by  her  right  hand,  and  you  must  \nmarry  her.  I  feel  that  you  are  in  every  way  \nworthy to be my husband.\" \nYayati    replied:    \"Loving    soul,    I    am    a \nkshatriya  and  you  are  a  brahmana  maiden.  \nHow   can   I   marry   you?   How   can   the \ndaughter  of  Sukracharya,  who  is  worthy  to  \nbe   the   preceptor   of   the   whole   world, \nsubmit  to  be  the  wife  of  a  kshatriya  like \nmyself?     Revered lady,     return     home.\" \nHaving  said  these  words  Yayati  went  back  \nto his capital.  \nA     kshatriya     maiden     could     marry     a \nbrahmana,     according     to     the     ancient \ntradition,  but  it  was  considered  wrong  for \na  brahmana  maiden  to  marry  a  kshatriya. \nThe  important  thing  was  to  keep  the  racial  \nstatus     of     women     unlowered.     Hence \nanuloma  or  the  practice  of  marrying  men \nof   higher   castes   was   legitimate   and   the \nreverse  practice,  known  as  pratiloma,  i.e. \nmarrying    men    of    a    lower    caste,    was \nprohibited by the sastras.  \nDevayani   had   no   mind to   return   home. \nShe  remained  sunk  in  sorrow  in  the  shade  \nof   a   tree   in   forest.   Sukracharya   loved \nDevayani  more  than  his  life.  After  waiting \nlong  in  vain  for  the  return  of  his  daughter \nwho     had     gone     to     play     with     her \ncompanions,  he  sent  a  woman  in  search  of  \nher.  \nThe  messenger  after  a  weary  search  came  \non  her  at  last  near  the  tree  where  she  was  \nsitting   in   dejection,   her   eyes   red   with \nanger  and  grief.  And  she  asked  her  what \nhad happened. \nDevayani  said:  \"Friend,  go  at  once  and  tell  \nmy  father  that  I  will  not  set  my  foot  in  the  \ncapital   of   Vrishaparva\"   and   she   sent   her \nback to Sukracharya.  \nExtremely  grieved  at  the  sad  plight  of  his \ndaughter Sukracharya hurried to her. \nCaressing  her,  he  said:  \"It  is  by  their  own \nactions,  good  or  bad,  that  men  are  happy \nor    miserable. The    virtues    or    vices    of \nothers  will  not  affect  us  in  the  least.\"  With \nthese    words    of    wisdom,    he    tried    to \nconsole her. \nShe  replied  in  sorrow  and  anger:  \"Father, \nleave   alone   my   merits   and   faults,   which \nare  after  all  my  own  concern.  But  tell  me  \nthis,    was    Sarmishtha,    the    daughter    of \nVrishaparva,  right  when  she  told  me  you \nwere  but  a  minstrel  singing  the  praises  of \nkings?   She   called   me   the   daughter   of   a \nmendicant   living   on   the   doles   won   by \nflattery.   Not   content   with   this   arrogant \ncontumely,  she  slapped  me  and  threw  me  \n\ninto  a  pit  which  was  nearby.  I  cannot  stay \nin   any   place   within   her   father's   territory.\" \nAnd Devayani began to weep.  \nSukracharya    drew    himself    up    proudly: \n\"Devayani,\"  he  said  with  dignity,  \"you  are \nnot  the  daughter  of  a  court  minstrel.  Your  \nfather   does   not   live   on   the   wages   of \nflattery.  You  are  the  daughter  of  one  who  \nis  reverenced  by  all  the  world.  Indra,  the \nking    of    the    gods,    knows    this,    and \nVrishaparva  is  not  ignorant  of  his  debt  to \nme.   But   no   worthy   man   extols   his   own \nmerits,   and   I   shall   say   no   more   about \nmyself.   Arise,   you   are   a   peerless   gem \namong    women,    bringing    prosperity    to \nyour family. Be patient. Let us go home.\"  \nIn   this   context   Bhagavan   Vyasa   advises \nhumanity     in     general     in     the     following \nwords      of      counsel      addressed      by \nSukracharya to his daughter: \n\"He   conquers   the   world,   who   patiently \nputs  up  with  the  abuse  of  his  neighbors. \nHe  who,  controls  his  anger,  as  a  horseman  \nbreaks    an    unruly    horse,    is    indeed    a \ncharioteer   and   not   he   who   merely   holds \nthe  reins,  but  lets  the  horse  go  whither  it \nwould.  He  who  sheds  his  anger  just  as  a  \nsnake  its  slough,  is  a  real  hero.  He  who  is  \nnot   moved   despite   the   greatest   torments \ninflicted  by  others,  will  realise  his  aim.  He  \nwho   never   gets   angry   is   superior   to   the \nritualist   who   faith   fully   performs   for   a \nhundred   years   the   sacrifices   ordained   by \nscripture.  Servants,  friends,  brothers,  wife, \nchildren,  virtue  and  truth  abandon  the  man \nwho  gives  way  to  anger.  The  wise  will  not  \ntake to heart the words of boys and girls.\"  \nDevayani   humbly   told   her   father:   \"I   am \nindeed   a   little girl,   but,   I   hope,   not   too \nyoung  to  benefit  by  the  great  truth  taught \nby  you.  Yet,  it  is  not  proper  to  live  with \npersons  who  have  no  sense  of  decency  or  \ndecorum.  The  wise  will  not  keep  company \nwith   those   who   speak   ill   of   their   family. \nHowever    rich    they    may    be,    the    ill-\nmannered      are      really      the      veritable \nchandalas   outside   the   pale   of   caste.   The \nvirtuous   should   not   mix   with   them.   My \nmind   is   ablaze   with   the   anger   roused   by \nthe   taunts   of   Vrishaparva's   daughter.   The \nwounds  inflicted  by  weapons  may  close  in \ntime;    scalds    may    heal    gradually;    but \nwounds   inflicted   by   words   remain   painful \nas long as one lives.\"  \nSukracharya    went    to    Vrishaparva    and \nfixing his eyes on him gravely said: \n\"O  king,  though  one's  sins  may  not  bring \nimmediate     punishment     they     are     sure, \nsooner  or  later,  to  destroy  the  very  germ \nof     prosperity.     Kacha,     the     son     of \nBrihaspati,   was   a   brahmacharin   who   had \nconquered  his  senses  and  never  committed  \nany   sin.   He   served   me   with   fidelity   and \nnever   strayed   from   the   path   of   virtue. \nYour  attendants  tried  to  kill  him.  I  bore  it.  \nMy   daughter,   who   holds   her   honor   high, \nhad  to  hear  dishonoring  words  uttered  by \nyour   daughter.   Besides,   she   was   pushed \ninto  a  well  by  your  daughter.  She  cannot \nany   more   stay   in   your   kingdom.   Without \nher   I   cannot   live   here   either.   So,   I   am \ngoing out of your kingdom.\"  \nAt  these  words  the  king  of  the  asuras  was  \nsorely  troubled  and  said:  \"I  am  ignorant  of \nthe    charges    laid    at    my    door.    If    you \nabandon me, I shall enter fire and die.\"  \nSukracharya  replied:  \"I  care  more  for  the \nhappiness  of  my  daughter  than  for  the  fate  \nof  you  and  your  asuras,  for  she  is  the  one  \nthing   I   have   and   dearer   to   me   than   life \nitself.   If   you   can   appease   her,   it   is   well \nand good. Otherwise I go.\"  \nVrishaparva   and   his   retinue   went   to   the \ntree  under  which  Devayani  stood  and  they \nthrew      themselves      at      her      feet      in \nsupplication. \nDevayani      was      stubborn      and      said: \n\"Sarmishtha   who   told   me   that   I   was   the \ndaughter  of  a  beggar,  should  become  my \nhandmaiden  and  attend  on  me  in  the  house  \ninto     which     my     father     gives     me     in \nmarriage.\" \n\nVrishaparva    consented    and    asked    his \nattendants       to       fetch       his       daughter \nSarmishtha.  \nSarmishtha   admitted   her   fault   and   bowed \nin  submission.  She  said:  \"Let  it  be  as  my \ncompanion   Devayani   desires.   My   father \nshall   not   lose   his   preceptor   for   a   fault \ncommitted  by  me.  I  will  be  her  attendant,\" \nDevayani  was  pacified  and  returned  to  her  \nhouse with her father. \nOn  another  occasion  also  Devayani  came \nacross   Yayati.   She   repeated   her   request \nthat  he  should  take  her  as  his  wife  since  he  \nhad   clasped   her   right   hand.   Yayati   again \nrepeated  his  objection  that  he,  a  kshatriya,  \ncould not lawfully marry a brahmana.  \nFinally  they  both  went  to  Sukracharya  and  \ngot  his  assent  to  their  marriage.  This  is  an \ninstance   of   the   pratiloma   marriage   which \nwas  resorted  to  on  exceptional  occasions. \nThe   sastras,   no   doubt,  prescribe  what  is \nright   and   forbid   what   is   wrong   but   a \nmarriage   once   effected   cannot   be   made \ninvalid.  \nYayati  and  Devayani  spent  many  days  in \nhappiness.   Sarmishtha   remained   with   her \nas  an  attendant.  One  day  Sarmishtha  met \nYayati   in   secret   and   earnestly   prayed   to \nbetaken  also  as  his  wife.  He  yielded  to  her  \nprayer    and    married    her    without    the \nknowledge of Devayani. \nBut  Devayani  came  to  know  of  it  and  was  \nnaturally   very   angry,   She   complained   to \nher   father   and   Sukracharya   in   his   rage \ncursed Yayati with premature old age.  \nYayati,  thus  suddenly  stricken  with  age  in \nthe  very  prime  of  his  manhood,  begged  so  \nhumbly   for   forgiveness   that   Sukracharya, \nwho   had   not   forgotten   Devayani's   rescue \nfrom the well, at last relented. \nHe  said:  \"O  king,  you  have  lost  the  glory \nwhich    is    youth.    The    curse    cannot    be \nrecalled,  but  if  you  can  persuade  anyone \nto   exchange   his   youth   for   your   age   the \nexchange     will     take     effect.\"     Thus     he \nblessed Yayati and bade him farewell. \n",

He    had    five \nbeautiful       sons,       all       virtuous       and \naccomplished.    Yayati    called them    and \nappealed piteously to their affection:  \n\"The       curse       of       your       grandfather \nSukracharya   has   made   me   unexpectedly \nand  prematurely  old.  I  have  not  had  my \nfill   of   the   joys   of   life.   For,   not   knowing \nwhat  was  in  store  for  me  I  lived  a  life  of \nrestraint,     denying     myself     even     lawful \npleasures.  One  of  you  ought  to  bear  the \nburden  of  my  old  age  and  give  his  youth \nin   return.   He   who   agrees   to   this   and \nbestows  his  youth  on  me  will  be  the  ruler  \nof   my   kingdom.   I   desire   to   enjoy   life   in \nthe full vigor of youth.\" \nHe   first   asked   his   eldest   son.   That   son \nreplied:     \"O     great     king,     women     and \nservants  will  mock  at  me  if  I  were  to  take  \nupon  myself  your  old  age.  I  cannot  do  go.  \nAsk   of   my   younger   brothers   who   are \ndearer to you than myself.\"  \nWhen  the  second  son  was  approached,  he  \ngently   refused   with   the   words:   \"Father, \nyou   ask   me   to   take   up   old   age   that \n\ndestroys  not  only  strength  and  beauty  but \nalso   as   I   see   wisdom.   I   am   not   strong \nenough to do so.\"  \nThe  third  son  replied:  \"An  old  man  cannot  \nride   a   horse   or   an   elephant.   His   speech \nwill   falter.   What   can   I   do   in   such   a \nhelpless plight? I cannot agree.\" \nThe  king  was  angry  and  disappointed  that  \nhis  three  sons  had  declined  to  do  as  he \nwished,  but  he  hoped  for  better  from  his \nfourth  son,  to  whom  he  said:  \"You  should  \ntake  up  my  old  age.  If  you  exchange  your  \nyouth  with  me,  I  shall  give  it  back  to  you \nafter  some  time  and  take  back  the  old  age  \nwith which I have been cursed.\" \nThe  fourth  son  begged  to  be  forgiven  as \nthis   was   a   thing   he   could   by   no   means \nconsent  to.  An  old  man  had  to  seek  the \nhelp  of  others  even  to  keep  his  body  clean,  \na   most   pitiful   plight.   No,   much   as   he \nloved his father he could not do it.  \nYayati   was   struck   with   sorrow   at   the \nrefusal    of    the    four    sons.    Still,    hoping \nagainst   hope,   he   supplicated   his   last   son \nwho   had   never   yet   opposed   his   wishes: \n\"You   must   save   me.   I   am   afflicted   with \nthis  old  age  with  its  wrinkles,  debility  and \ngrey   hairs   as   a   result   of   the   curse   of \nSukracharya.  It  is  too  hard  a  trial!  If  you \nwill  take  upon  yourself  these  infirmities,  I \nshall  enjoy  life  for  just a  while  more  and  \nthen  give  you  back  your  youth  and  resume  \nmy  old  age  and  all  its  sorrows.  Pray,  do \nnot   refuse   as   your   elder   brothers   have \ndone.\" \nPuru,   the   youngest   son,   moved   by   filial \nlove,   said:   \"Father,   I   gladly   give   you   my \nyouth   and   relieve   you   of   the sorrows  of \nold age and cares of state. Be happy.\" \nHearing    these    words    Yayati    embraced \nhim.   As   soon   as   he   touched   his   son, \nYayati    became    a    youth.    Puru,    who \naccepted  the  old  age  of  his  father,  ruled \nthe   kingdom   and   acquired   great   renown. \nYayati    enjoyed    life for    long,    and    not \nsatisfied,    went    later    to    the    garden    of \nKubera   and   spent   many   years   with   an \nApsara maiden. \nAfter   long   years   spent   in   vain   efforts   to \nquench    desire    by    indulgence,    the    truth \ndawned on him.  \nReturning   to   Puru,   he   said:   \"Dear   son, \nsensual    desire    is    never    quenched    by \nindulgence    any    more    than    fire    is    by \npouring  ghee  in  it.  I  had  heard  and  read \nthis,  but  till  now  I  had  not  realised  it.  No  \nobject   of   desire,   corn,   gold,   cattle   or \nwomen,  nothing  can  ever  satisfy  the  desire  \nof  man,  We  can  reach  peace only  by  a \nmental   poise   beyond   likes   and   dislikes. \nSuch  is  the  state  of  Brahman.  Take  back \nyour   youth   and   rule   the   kingdom   wisely \nand well.\"  \nWith  these  words  Yayati  took  his  old  age.  \nPuru,  who  regained  his  youth,  was  made \nking  by  Yayati  who  retired  to  the forest. \nHe  spent  his  time  there  in  austerities  and, \nin due course, attained heaven. \n",

One  day  while  he  \nwas    immersed    in    silent    contemplation \nunder  the  shade  of  a  tree  outside  his  hut  of  \nleaves,  a  band  of  robbers  fled  through  the  \nwoods   with   officers   of   the   king   in   hot \npursuit.  \nThe      fugitives      entered      the      ashrama \nthinking   that   it   would   be   a   convenient \nplace  to  hide  themselves  in.  They  placed \ntheir  booty  in  a  corner  and  hid  themselves.  \nThe   soldiers   of   the   king   came   to   the \nashrama tracking their footsteps. \nThe    commander    of    the    soldiers    asked \nMandavya, who     was     rapt     in     deep \nmeditation    in    a    tone    of    peremptory \ncommand:  \"Did  you  see  the  robbers  pass \nby?  Where  did  they  go?  Reply  at  once  so  \n\nthat    we    may    give    chase    and    capture \nthem.\"  \nThe   sage,   who   was   absorbed   in   yoga, \nremained  silent.  The  commander  repeated \nthe  question  insolently.    But  the  sage  did \nnot   hear   anything.   In   the   meantime   some \nof  the  attendants  entered  the  ashrama  and  \ndiscovered the stolen goods lying there.  \nThey   reported   this   to   their   commander. \nAll  of  them  went  in  and  found  the  stolen \ngoods and the robbers who were in hiding. \nThe   commander   thought:   \"Now   I   know \nthe  reason  why  the  brahmana  pretended  to  \nbe  a  silent  sage.  He  is  indeed  the  chief  of \nthese    robbers.    He    has    inspired    this \nrobbery.\"  Then  he  ordered  his  soldiers  to \nguard  the  place,  went  to  the  king  and  told  \nhim   that   the   sage   Mandavya   had   been \ncaught with the stolen goods.  \nThe  king  was  very  angry  at  the  audacity \nof  the  chief  of  the  robbers  who  had  put  on  \nthe  garb  of  a  brahmana  sage,  the  better  to  \ndeceive   the   world.   Without   pausing   to \nverify   the   facts,   he   ordered   the   wicked \ncriminal,    as    he    thought    him,    to    be \nimpaled.  \nThe      commander      returned      to      the \nhermitage,  impaled  Mandavya  on  a  spear \nand  handed  over  the  stolen  things  to  the \nking.  \nThe  virtuous  sage,  though  impaled  on  the \nspear,  did  not  die.  Since  he  was  in  yoga  \nwhen   he   was   impaled   he   remained   alive \nby  the  power  of  yoga.  Sages  who  lived  in \nother   parts   of   the   forest   came   to   his \nhermitage   and   asked   Mandavya   how   he \ncame to be in that terrible pass.  \nMandavya  replied:  \"Whom  shall  I  blame? \nThe  servants  of  the  king,  who  protect  the  \nworld, have inflicted this punishment.\" \nThe   king   was   surprised   and   frightened \nwhen  he  heard  that  the  impaled  sage  was  \nstill  alive  and  that  he  was  surrounded  by \nthe  other  sages  of  the  forest.  He  hastened  \nto   the   forest   with   his   attendants   and   at \nonce  ordered  the  sage  to  be  taken  down \nfrom  the  spear.  Then  he  prostrated  at  his \nfeet  and  prayed  humbly  to  be  forgiven  for  \nthe offence unwittingly committed. \nMandavya   was   not   angry   with   the   king. \nHe   went   straight   to   Dharma,   the   divine \ndispenser   of   justice,   who   was   seated   on \nhis   throne,   and   asked   him:   \"What   crime \nhave I committed to deserve this torture?\"  \nLord  Dharma,  who  knew  the  great  power  \nof   the   sage,   replied   in   all   humility:   \"O \nsage,   you   have   tortured   birds   and   bees. \nAre  you  not  aware  that  all  deeds,  good  or  \nbad,    however    small,    inevitably    produce \ntheir results, good or evil?\" \nMandavya   was   surprised   at   this   reply   of \nLord   Dharma   and   asked:   \"When   did   I \ncommit this offence?\"  \nLord  Dharma  replied:  \"When  you  were  a \nchild.\"  \nMandavya   then   pronounced   a   curse   on \nDharma:     \"This     punishment     you     have \ndecreed  is  far  in  excess  of  the  deserts  of  a  \nmistake     committed     by     a     child     in \nignorance.  Be  born,  therefore,  as  a  mortal \nin the world.\" \nLord  Dharma  who  was  thus  cursed  by  the  \nsage  Mandavya  incarnated  as  Vidura  and \nwas     born     of     the     servant-maid     of \nAmbalika, the wife of Vichitravirya. \nThis  story  is  intended  to  show  that  Vidura  \nwas  the  incarnation  of  Dharma.  The  great \nmen   of   the   world   regarded   Vidura   as   a \nmahatma    who    was    unparalleled    in    his \nknowledge     of     dharma,     sastras     and \nstatesmanship   and   was   totally   devoid   of \nattachment   and   anger.   Bhishma   appointed \nhim,  while  he  was  still  in  his  teens,  as  the  \nchief counsellor of king Dhritarashtra. \nVyasa   has   it   that   no   one   in   the   three \nworlds   could   equal   Vidura   in   virtue   and \nknowledge.   When   Dhritarashtra   gave   his, \npermission   for   the   game   of   dice,   Vidura \nfell  at  his  feet  and  protested  solemnly:  \"O \nking   and   lord,   I   cannot   approve   of   this \naction.  Strife  will  set  in  among  your  sons \nas a result. Pray, do not allow this.\" \n\nDhritarashtra   also   tried   in   manly   ways   to \ndissuade  his  wicked  son.  He  said  to  him: \n\"Do   not   proceed   with   this   game.   Vidura \ndoes  not  approve  of  it,  the  wise  Vidura  of  \nlofty   intellect   who   is   ever   intent   on   our \nwelfare.   He   says   the   game   is   bound   to \nresult   in   a   fierceness   of   hate   which   will \nconsume us and our kingdom.\"  \nBut  Duryodhana  did  not  heed  this  advice. \nCarried   away   by   his   doting   fondness   for \nhis    son,    Dhritarashtra    surrendered    his \nbetter   judgment   and   sent   to   Yudhishthira \nthe fateful invitation to the game. \n",

Since    his    cousin \nKuntibhoja   was   childless,   Sura   gave   his \ndaughter  Pritha  in  adoption  to  him.  From \nthat  time  she was  known  by  the  name  of \nKunti after her adoptive father. \nWhen   Kunti   was   a   little   girl,   the   sage \nDurvasa  stayed  for  a  time  as  a  guest  in  her  \nfather's  house  and  she  served  the  sage  for  \na    year    with    all    care,    patience    and \ndevotion.  He  was  so  pleased  with  her  that \nhe gave her a divine mantra. He said: \n\"If   you   call   upon   any   god   repeating   this \nmantra,   he   will   manifest   himself   to   you \nand  bless  you  with  a  son  equal  to  him  in \nglory.\"  He  granted  her  this  boon  because \nhe    foresaw    by    his    yogic    power    the \nmisfortune  that  was  in  store  for  her  future  \nhusband.  \nThe    impatient    curiosity    of    youth    made \nKunti   test   then   and   there   the   efficacy   of \nthe   mantra   by   repeating   it   and   invoking \nthe   Sun   whom   she   saw   shining   in   the \nheavens.  At  once  the  sky  grew  dark  with \nclouds,  and  under  cover  of  them  the  Sun \ngod    approached    the    beautiful    princess \nKunti  and  stood  gazing  at  her  with  ardent  \nsoul        scorching        admiration.        Kunti, \noverpowered  by  the  glorious  vision  of  her  \ndivine   visitor,   asked:   \"O   god,   who   art \nthou?\"  \nThe  Sun  replied:  \"Dear  maiden,  I  am  the  \nSun.  I  have  been  drawn  to  you  by  the  spell  \nof   the   son-giving   mantra   that   you   have \nuttered.\"  \nKunti   was   aghast   and   said:   \"I   am   an \nunwedded  girl  dependent  on  my  father.  I \nam   not   fit   for   motherhood   and   do   not \ndesire  it.  I  merely  wished  to  test  the  power  \nof  the  boon  granted  by  the  sage  Durvasa.  \nGo  back  and  forgive  this  childish  folly  of \nmine.\"   But   the   Sun   god   could   not   thus \nreturn   because   the   power   of   the   mantra \nheld   him.   She   for   her   part   was   mortally \nafraid  of  being  blamed  by  the  world.  The \nSun god however reassured her: \n\"No    blame    shall    attach    to    you.    After \nbearing my son, you will regain virginity.'' \nKunti  conceived  by  the  grace  of  the  Sun, \nthe  giver  of  light  and  life  to  all  the  world.  \nDivine     births     take     place     immediately \nwithout  the  nine  months  weary  course  of \nmortal gestation.  \nShe   gave   birth   to   Karna   who   was   born \nwith   divine   armor   and   earrings   and   was \nbright  and  beautiful  like  the  Sun.  In  time, \nhe   became   one   of   the   world's   greatest \nheroes.  After  the  birth  of  the  child,  Kunti \nonce  again  became  a  virgin  as  a  result  of \nthe boon granted by the Sun.  \nShe   wondered   what   she   should   do   with \nthe  child.  To  hide  her  fault  she  placed  the  \nchild  in  a  sealed  box  and  set  it  afloat  in  a  \nriver.   A   childless   charioteer   happened   to \nsee   the   floating   case,   and   taking   it,   was \nsurprised  and  delighted  to  see  within  it  a \ngorgeously beautiful child. \nHe    handed    it    over    to    his    wife    who \nlavished    a    mother's    love    on    it.    Thus \nKarna,  the  son  of  the  Sun  god,  came  to  be  \nbrought  up  as  a  charioteer's  child.  When \nthe     time     came     for     giving     Kunti     in \nmarriage,     Kuntibhoja     invited     all     the \nneighboring       princes       and       held       a \n\nswayamvara     for     her     to     choose     her \nhusband.  \nMany     eager     suitors     flocked     to     the \nswayamvara   as   the   princess   was   widely \nfamed   for   her   great   beauty   and   virtue. \nKunti  placed  the  garland  on  the  neck  of \nKing   Pandu,   the   bright   representative   of \nthe     Bharata     race,     whose     personality \neclipsed  the  lustre  of  all  the  other  princes \nassembled   there.   The   marriage   was   duly \nsolemnised    and    she    accompanied    her \nhusband to his capital Hastinapur. \nOn    the    advice    of    Bhishma    and    in \naccordance    with    the    prevailing    custom, \nPandu  took  a  second  wife  Madri,  the  sister  \nof  the  king  of  Madra.  In  the  old  days  the  \nkings  took  two  or  three  wives  for  making \nsure  of  progeny  and  not  for  mere  sensual \ndesire. \n",

Stricken  \nto    death    the    rishi    thus    cursed    Pandu: \n\"Sinner,    you    will   meet   with   death   the \nmoment   you   taste   the   pleasures   of   the \nbed.\"  \nPandu  was  heartbroken  at  this  curse  and \nretreated  to  the  forest  with  his  wives  after  \nentrusting   his   kingdom   to   Bhishma   and \nVidura   and   lived   there   a   life   of   perfect \nabstinence.  \nSeeing     that    Pandu    was    desirous    of \noffspring,    which    the    rishi’s    curse    had \ndenied   him,   Kunti   confided   to   him   the \nstory  of  the  mantra  she  had  received  from \nDurvasa.

King   Pandu   lived \nfor  many  years  in  the  forest  with  his  wives  \nand  children.  It  was  springtime.  And  one \nday  Pandu  and  Madri  forgot  their  sorrows  \nin    the    rapture    of    sympathy    with    the \nthrobbing    life    around    them,    the    happy \nflowers,      creepers,      birds      and      other \ncreatures of the forest.  \nIn  spite  of  Madri’s  earnest  and  repeated \nprotests   Pandu’s   resolution   broke   down \nunder    the    exhilarating    influence    of    the \nseason,  and  at  once  the  curse  of  the  sage  \ntook effect and Pandu fell, dead. \nMadri  could  not  contain  her  sorrow.  Since  \nshe   felt   that   she   was   responsible   for   the \ndeath  of  the  king.  She  burnt  herself  on  the  \npyre   of   her   husband   entreating   Kunti   to \nremain   and   be   a   mother   to   her   doubly \norphaned children. \nThe  sages  of  the  forest  took  the  bereaved  \nand  grief-stricken  Kunti  and  the  Pandavas \nto    Hastinapura    and    entrusted    them    to \nBhishma. \nYudhishthira  was  but  sixteen  years  old  at \nthat    time.

Bhima   excelled \nthem  all  in  physical  prowess.  He  used  to \nbully  Duryodhana  and  the  other  Kauravas \nby  dragging  them  by  the  hair  and  beating \nthem.  \nA   great   swimmer,   he   would   dive,   into \npools,  with  one  or  more  of  them  clasped \nhelpless   in   his   arms,   and   remain   under \nwater    till    they    were    almost    drowned. \nWhenever   they climbed  up  on  a  tree  he \nwould  stand  on  the  ground  and  kick  at  the  \ntree and shake them down like ripe fruits.  \nThe   bodies   of   the   sons   of   Dhritarashtra \nwould  be  ever  sore  with  bruises  as  a  result  \nof   Bhima's   practical   jokes.   Small   wonder \nthat   the   sons   of   Dhritarashtra   nursed   a \ndeep   hatred   for   Bhima   from   their   very \ninfancy. \nAs    the    princes    grew    up.    Kripacharya \ntaught   them   archery   and   the   practice   of \narms  and  other  things  that  princes  should \nlearn.     Duryodhana's     jealousy     towards \nBhima   warped   his   mind   and   made   him \ncommit many improper acts. \nDuryodhana  was  very  much  worried.  His \nfather  being  blind,  the  kingdom  was  ruled \nby   Pandu.   After   his   death   Yudhishthira, \nthe  heir-apparent,  would  in  course  of  time  \nbecome  king.  Duryodhana  thought  that  as \nhis    blind    father    was    quite   helpless   he \nmust,   to   prevent   Yudhishthira's   accession \nto   the   throne,   contrive   a   way   of   killing \nBhima.  \nHe   made   arrangements   to   carry   out   his \nresolve   since   he   thought   that   the   powers \nof   the   Pandavas   would   decline   with   the \ndeath of Bhima.  \nDuryodhana   and   his   brothers   planned   to \nthrow   Bhima   into   the   Ganges,   imprison \nArjuna   and   Yudhishthira,   and   then   seize \nthe   kingdom   and   rule   it.   So   Duryodhana \nwent  with  his  brothers  and  the  Pandavas \nfor a swim in the Ganges.  \nAfter   the   sports   they   slept   in   their   tents \nbeing     exhausted.     Bhima     had     exerted \nhimself   more   than   the   others   and   as   his \nfood   had   been   poisoned,   he   felt   drowsy \nand   lay   down   on   the   bank   of   the   river. \nDuryodhana      bound      him      with      wild \ncreepers and threw him into the river.  \nThe   evil   Duryodhana   had   already   caused \nsharp   spikes   to   be   planted   on   the   spot. \nThis   was   done   purposely   so   that   Bhima \nmight  in  falling  be  impaled  on  the  spikes, \nand  lose  his  life.  Fortunately  there  was  no  \nspike    in    the    place    where    Bhima    fell. \nPoisonous water-snakes bit his body.  \nThe   poisonous   food   he   had   taken   was \ncounteracted   by   the   snake   poison   and \nBhima   came   to   no   harm,   and   presently, \nthe river washed him to a bank.  \nDuryodhana    thought    that    Bhima    must \nhave  died  as  he  had  been  thrown  in  the \nriver   infested   with   poisonous   snakes   and \nplanted  with spikes.  So  he  returned  to  the  \ncity with the rest of the party in great joy. \nWhen    Yudhishthira    inquired    about    the \nwhereabouts      of      Bhima,      Duryodhana \ninformed  him  that  he  had  preceded  them \nto the city. \nYudhishthira   believed   Duryodhana   and   as \nsoon   as   he   returned   home,   asked   his \nmother     whether     Bhima     had     returned \nhome.  \nHis   anxious   question   brought   forth   the \nreply   that   Bhima   had   not   yet   returned, \nwhich    made    Yudhishthira    suspect    some \nfoul  play  against  his  brother.  And  he  went  \nagain  with  his  brothers  to  the  forest  and \nsearched   everywhere.   But   Bhima   could \nnot   be   found.   They   went   back   in   great \nsorrow. \nSometime  later  Bhima  awoke  and  trudged \nwearily       back       home.       Kunti       and \nYudhishthira        welcomed        him        and \nembraced  him  in  great  joy.  By  the  poison \nthat  had  entered  his  system  Bhima  became  \nstronger than before. \n\nKunti   sent   for   Vidura   and   told   him   in \nsecret: \n\"Duryodhana    is    wicked    and    cruel.    He \nseeks  to  kill  Bhima  since  he  wants  to  rule  \nthe kingdom. I am worried.\" \nVidura  replied:  \"What  you  say  is  true,  but  \nkeep  your  thoughts  to  yourself.  For  if  the  \nwicked  Duryodhana  is  accused  or  blamed,  \nhis   anger   and   hatred   will   only   increase. \nYour  sons  are  blessed  with  long  life.  You \nneed have no fear on that account.\" \nYudhishthira  also  warned  Bhima  and  said: \n\"Be  silent  over  the  matter.  Hereafter,  we \nhave  to  be  careful  and  help  one  another \nand protect ourselves.\" \nDuryodhana   was   surprised   to   see   Bhima \ncome  back  alive.  His  jealousy  and  hatred \nincreased.   He   heaved   a   deep   sigh   and \npined away in sorrow. \n",

A  day \nwas  fixed  for  a  test  and  exhibition  of  their  \nproficiency   in   the   use   of   arms   in   the \npresence   of   the   royal   family   and   as   the \npublic  had  also  been  invited  to  witness  the  \nperformance    of    their    beloved    princes. \nThere was a large and enthusiastic crowd.  \nArjuna    displayed    superhuman    skill    with \nhis  weapons  and  the  vast  assemblage  was  \nlost       in       wonder       and       admiration. \nDuryodhana's   brow   was   dark   with   envy \nand hate. \nAt   the   close   of   the   day,   there   came \nsuddenly  from  the  entrance  of  the  arena  a  \nsound,   loud   and   compelling   like   thunder \nthe  sound  made  by  the  slapping  of  mighty \narms  in  challenge.  All  eyes  turned  in  that \ndirection.    They    saw    enter    through    the \ncrowd,  which  made  way  in  awed  silence, \na   godlike   youth   from   whom   light   and \npower   seemed   to   emanate.   He   looked \nproudly  round  him,  cast  a  negligent  salute \nto   Drona   and   Kripa,   and   strode   up   to \nArjuna.  The  brothers,  all  unaware,  by  the \nbitter    irony    of    fate,    of    their    common \nblood,    faced    one    another;    for    it    was \nKarna. \nKarna  addressed  Arjuna  in  a  voice  deep  as  \nrumbling   thunder:   \"Arjuna,   I   shall   show \ngreater skill than you have displayed.\" \nWith   Drona's   leave,   Karna   the   lover   of \nbattle,   then   and   there   duplicated   all   of \nArjuna's   feats   with   careless   ease.   Great \nwas    Duryodhana's   exultation.   He   threw \nhis     arms     round     Karna     and     said: \n\"Welcome,    O    thou    with    mighty    arms, \nwhom  good  fortune  has  sent  to  us.  I  and  \nthis   kingdom   of   the   Kurus   are   at   your \ncommand.\"  \nSaid   Karna:   \"I,   Karna,   am   grateful,   O \nking.   Only   two   things   I   seek,   your   love \nand single combat with Partha.\" \nDuryodhana   clasped   Karna   again   to   his \nbosom   and   said:   \"My   prosperity   is   all \nthine to enjoy.\"  \nAs  love  flooded  Duryodhana's  heart,  even \nso  did  blazing  wrath  fill  Arjuna,  who  felt \naffronted.   And   glaring   fiercely   at   Karna \nwho   stood,   stately   as   a   mountain   peak, \nreceiving    the    greetings    of    the    Kaurava \nbrothers,  he  said:  \"O  Karna,  slain  by  me \nthou    shalt    presently    go    to    the    hell \nappointed  for  those  who  intrude  uninvited \nand prate unbidden.\" \nKarna   laughed   in   scorn:   \"This   arena   is \nopen   to   all,   O   Arjuna,   and   not   to   you \nalone.  Might  is  the  sanction  of  sovereignty \nand  the  law  is  based  on  it.  But  what  is  the  \nuse  of  mere  talk  which  is  the  weapon  of \nthe weak? Shoot arrows instead of words.\"  \nThus    challenged,    Arjuna,    with    Drona's \npermission,   hastily   embraced   his   brothers \nand  stood  ready  for  combat.  While  Karna,  \ntaking     leave     of     the     Kuru     brothers, \nconfronted him weapon in hand. \nAnd,  as  though  the  divine  parents  of  the \nheroes  sought  to  encourage  their  offspring \nand   witness   this   fateful   battle,   Indra,   the \nlord  of  the  thunderclouds,  and  Bhaskara  of  \n\nthe  in  finite  rays,  simultaneously  appeared \nin the heavens.  \nWhen  she  saw  Karna,  Kunti  knew  him  as  \nher   first   born   and   fainted   away.   Vidura \ninstructed  the  maidservant  to  attend  upon \nher  and  she  revived.  She  stood  stupefied \nwith anguish not knowing what to do. \nAs   they   were   about   to   join   in   battle, \nKripa,   well-versed   in   the   rules   of   single \ncombat,     stepped     between     them     and \naddressed Karna: \n\"This   prince,   who   is   ready   to   fight   with \nthee,  is  the  son  of  Pritha  and  Pandu  and  a  \nscion  of  the  Kuru  race.  Reveal  O  mighty \narmed  thy  parentage  and  the  race  rendered  \nillustrious   by   thy   birth.   It   is   only   after \nknowing   thy   lineage   that   Partha   can   fight \nwith   thee,   for   high-born   princes   cannot \nengage   in   single   combat   with   unknown \nadventurers.\" \nWhen  he  heard  these  words,  Karna  bent \ndown   his   head   like   a   lotus   under   the \nweight of rainwater. \nDuryodhana   stood   up   and   said:   \"If   the \ncombat  cannot  take  place  merely  because \nKarna  is  not  a  prince,  why,  that  is  easily \nremedied.  I  crown  Karna  as  the  king  of \nAnga.\"   He   then   obtained   the   assent   of \nBhishma   and   Dhritarashtra,   performed   all \nthe   necessary   rites   and   invested   Karna \nwith   the   sovereignty   of   the   kingdom   of \nAnga   giving   him   the   crown,   jewels   and \nother royal insignia. \nAt   that   moment,   as   the  combat  between \nthe    youthful    heroes    seemed    about    to \ncommence,   the   old   charioteer   Adhiratha, \nwho    was    the    foster-father    of    Karna, \nentered   the   assembly,   staff   in   hand   and \nquaking with fear.  \nNo  sooner  did  he  see  him,  that  Karna,  the  \nnewly  crowned  king  of  Anga,  bowed  his \nhead  and  did  humble  obeisance  in  all  filial \nreverence.   The   old   man   called   him   son, \nembraced  him  with  his  thin  and  trembling \narms,  and  wept  with  joy  wetting  with  tears  \nof  love  his  head  already  moistened  by  the  \nwater of the coronation. \nAt   this   sight,   Bhima   roared   with   laughter \nand  said:  \"O  he  is  after  all  only  the  son  of  \na   charioteer!   Take   up   the   driving   whip \nthen  as  befits  thy  parentage.  Thou  art  not \nworthy  of  death  at  the  hands  of  Arjuna. \nNor   shouldst   thou   reign   in   Anga   as   a \nking.\"  \nAt   this   outrageous   speech,   Karna's   lips \ntrembled  with  anguish  and  he  speechlessly \nlooked  up  at  the  setting  sun  with  a  deep \nsigh. \nBut Duryodhana broke in indignantly:  \n\"It   is   unworthy   of   you,   O   Vrikodara,   to \nspeak   thus.   Valor   is   the   hallmark   of   a \nkshatriya.   Nor   is   there   much   sense   in \ntracing   great   heroes   and   mighty   rivers   to \ntheir   sources.   I   could   give   you   hundreds \nof  instances  of  great  men  of  humble  birth \nand  I  know  awkward  questions  might  be \nasked   of   your   own   origin.   Look   at   this \nwarrior,  his  godlike  form  and  bearing,  his  \narmor   and   earrings,   and   his   skill   with \nweapons.   Surely   there   is   some   mystery \nabout  him.  For  how  could  a  tiger  be  born \nof  an  antelope?  Unworthy  of  being  king  of  \nAnga,   didst   thou   say?   I   verily   hold   him \nworthy to rule the whole world.\" \nIn    generous    wrath,    Duryodhana    took \nKarna in his chariot and drove away. \nThe   sun   set   and   the   crowd   dispersed   in \ntumult.   There   were   groups   loud   in   talk \nunder    the    light    of    the    lamps,    some \nglorifying     Arjuna,     others     Karna,     and \nothers    again    Duryodhana    according    to \ntheir predilection. \nIndra  foresaw  that  a  supreme  contest  was  \ninevitable   between   his   son   Arjuna   and \nKarna.   And   he   put   on   the   garb   of   a \nbrahmana  and  came  to  Karna,  who  was \nreputed  for  his  charity  and  begged  of  him \nhis  earrings  and  armor.  The  Sun  god  had \nalready   warned   Karna   in   a   dream   that \nIndra   would   try   to   deceive   him   in   this \nmanner.  \n\nStill,   Karna   could   not   bring   himself   to \nrefuse   any   gift   that   was   asked   of   him. \nHence  he  cut  off  the  earrings  and  armor \nwith  which  he  was  born  and  gave  them  to  \nthe brahmana. \nIndra,   the   king of   gods,   was   filled   with \nsurprise  and  joy.  After  accepting  the  gift, \nhe  praised  Karna  as  having  done  what  no  \none   else   would   do,   and,   shamed   into \ngenerosity,  bade  Karna  ask  for  any  boon \nhe wanted.  \nKarna    replied:    \"I    desire    to    get    your \nweapon,  the  Sakti,  which  has  the  power  to  \nkill  enemies.\"  Indra  granted  the  boon,  but \nwith  a  fateful  proviso.  He  said:  \"You  can \nuse   this   weapon   against   but   one   enemy, \nand  it  will  kill  him  whosoever  he  may  be.  \nBut  this  killing  done,  this  weapon  will  no \nlonger  be  available  to  you but  will  return \nto     me.\"     With     these     words     Indra \ndisappeared. \nKarna  went  to  Parasurama  and  became  his  \ndisciple   by   representing   to   him   that   he \nwas  a  brahmana.  He  learnt  of  Parasurama  \nthe   mantra   for   using   the   master   weapon \nknown as Brahmastra.  \nOne   day   Parasurama   was   reclining   with \nthe  head  on  Karna's  lap  when  a  stinging \nworm  burrowed  into  Karna's  thigh.  Blood \nbegan  to  flow  and  the  pain  was  terrible. \nBut  Karna  bore  it  without  tremor  lest  he \nshould      disturb      the      master's      sleep. \nParasurama  awoke  and  saw  the  blood  that \nhad poured from the wound.  \nHe   said:   \"Dear   pupil,   you   are   not   a \nbrahmana.   A   kshatriya   alone   can   remain \nunmoved   under   all   bodily   torments.   Tell \nme the truth.\" \nKarna  confessed  that  he  had  told  a  lie  in \npresenting  himself  as  a  brahmana  and  that \nhe was in fact the son of a charioteer. \nParasurama   in   his   anger   pronounced   this \ncurse   on   him:   \"Since   you   deceived   your \nguru,  the  Brahmastra  you  have  learnt  shall \nfail  you  at  the  fated  moment.  You  will  be  \nunable    to    recall    the    invocatory    mantra \nwhen your hour comes.\" \nIt   was   because   of   this   curse   that   at   the \ncrisis  of  his  last  fight  with  Arjuna,  Karna \nwas   not   able   to   recall   the   Brahmastra \nspell,   though   he   had   remembered   it   till \nthen.   Karna   was   the   faithful   friend   of \nDuryodhana    and    remained    loyally    with \nthe Kauravas until the end. \nAfter    the    fall    of    Bhishma    and    Drona, \nKarna  became  the  leader  of  the  Kaurava \narmy   and   fought   brilliantly   for   two   days. \nIn  the  end,  the  wheel  of  his  chariot  stuck  \nin  the  ground  and  be  was  not  able  to  lift  it  \nfree  and  drive  the  chariot  along.  While  he  \nwas    in    this    predicament,    Arjuna    killed \nhim.   Kunti   was   sunk   in   sorrow,   all   the \nmore   poignant   because   she   had,   at   that \ntime, to conceal it. \n",

Remembering   their   early   intimacy \nand  Drupada's  expressions  of  readiness  to  \nserve   him,   even   to   the   extent   of   sharing \nhis   kingdom,   Drona   went   to   him   in   the \nconfident       hope       of       being       treated \ngenerously. \nBut  he  found  the  king  very  different  from \nthe   student.   When   he   introduced   himself \nas  an  old  friend,  Drupada,  far  from  being \nglad   to   see   him,   felt   it   an   intolerable \npresumption.  \nDrunk   with   power   and   wealth,   Drupada \nsaid:  \"O  brahmana,  how  dare  you  address  \nme     familiarly     as     your     friend?     What \nfriendship  can  there  be  between  a  throned  \nking  and  a  wandering  beggar?  What  a  fool  \nmust  you  be  to  presume  on  some  long  past  \nacquaintance   to   claim   friend   ship   with   a \nking   who   rules   a   kingdom?   How   can   a \npauper  be  the  friend  of  a  wealthy  man,  or  \nan  ignorant  boor  of  a  learned  scholar,  or  a  \ncoward   of   a   hero?   Friendship   can   exist \nonly   between   equals.   A   vagrant   beggar \ncannot    be    the    friend    of    a    sovereign.\" \nDrona  was  turned  out  of  the  palace  with \nscorn  in  his  ears  and  a  blazing  wrath  in  his  \nheart. \nHe   made   a   mental   vow   to   punish   the \narrogant    king    for    this    insult    and    his \nrepudiation   of   the   sacred   claims   of   early \nfriendship.   His   next   move   in   search   of \nemployment   was   to   go   to   Hastinapura, \nwhere  he  spent  a  few  days,  in  retirement,  \nin     the     house     of     his     brother-in-law \nKripacharya.  \nOne  day,  the  princes  were  playing  with  a \nball  outside  the  precincts  of  the  city,  and \nin  the  course  of  the  game,  the  ball  as  well \nas  Yudhishthira's  ring  fell  into  a  well.  The \nprinces   had   gathered   round   the   well   and \nsaw    the    ring    shining    from    the    bottom \nthrough  the  clear  water.  But  could  see  no  \nway    of    getting    it    out.    They    did    not \nhowever,  notice  that  a  brahmana  of  dark \ncomplexion   stood   nearby   watching   them \nwith a smile.  \n\"Princes,\"   he   surprised   them   by   saying, \n\"you   are   the   descendants   of   the   heroic \nBharata  race.  Why  cannot  you  take  out  the  \nball    as    anyone    skilled    in    arms   should \nknow how to do? Shall I do it for you?\" \nYudhishthira   laughed   and   said   in   fun:   \"O \nbrahmana,  if  you  take  out  the  ball,  we  will  \nsee   that   you   have   a   good   meal   in   the \nhouse   of   Kripacharya.\"   Then   Drona   the \nbrahmana  stranger,  took  a  blade  of  grass \nand  sent  it  forth  into  the  well  after  reciting \ncertain  words  of  power  for  propelling  it  as  \nan arrow.  \nThe  blade  of  grass  straightway  sped  and \nstuck  into  the  ball.  Afterwards  he  sent  a \nnumber   of   similar   blades   in   succession \nwhich   clinging   together   formed   a   chain, \nwherewith Drona took out the ball. \nThe   princes   were   lost   in   amazement   and \ndelight  and  begged  of  him  to  get  the  ring \nalso.   Drona   borrowed   a   bow,   fixed   an \narrow  on  the  string  and  sent  it  right  into \nthe   ring.   The   arrow   rebounding   brought \nup  the  ring  and  the  brahmana  handed  it  to  \nthe prince with a smile.  \nSeeing    these    feats,    the    princes    were \nastonished   and   said:   \"We   salute   you,   O \nbrahmana.  Who  are  you?  Is  there  anything \nwe  can  do  for  you?\"  and  they  bowed  to \nhim. \nHe  said:  \"O  princes,  go  to  Bhishma  and \nlearn from him who I am.\" \nFrom  the  description  given  by  the  princes,  \nBhishma   knew   that   the   brahmana   was \nnone  other  than  the  famous  master  Drona.  \n\nHe   decided   that   Drona   was   the   fittest \nperson  to  impart  further  instruction  to  the \nPandavas  and  the  Kauravas.  So,  Bhishma \nreceived    him    with    special    honor    and \nemployed   him   to   instruct   the   princes   in \nthe use of arms.  \nAs  soon  as  the  Kauravas  and  the  Pandavas  \nhad   acquired   mastery   in   the   science   of \narms,  Drona  sent  Karna  and  Duryodhana \nto   seize   Drupada   and   bring   him   alive,   in \ndischarge  of  the  duty  they  owed  to  him  as  \ntheir master.  \nThey  went  as  ordered  by  him,  but  could \nnot  accomplish  their  task.  Then  the  master  \nsent  forth  Arjuna  on  the  same  errand.  He  \ndefeated   Drupada   in   battle   and   brought \nhim and his minister captives to Drona. \nThen   Drona   smilingly   addressed   Drupada: \n\"Great  king,  do  not  fear  for  your  life.  In \nour  boyhood  we  were  companions  but  you  \nwere  pleased  to  forget  it  and  dishonor  me.  \nYou  told  me  that  a  king  alone  could  be \nfriend  to  a  king.  Now  I  am  a  king,  having \nconquered your   kingdom.   Still   I   seek   to \nregain   my   friendship   with   you,   and   so   I \ngive   you   half   of   your   kingdom   that   has \nbecome  mine  by  conquest.  Your  creed  is \nthat   friendship   is   possible   only   between \nequals.  And  we  shall  now  be  equals,  each \nowning a half of your kingdom.\"  \nDrona   thought   this   sufficient   revenge   for \nthe  insult  he  had  suffered,  set  Drupada  at \nliberty     and     treated     him     with     honor. \nDrupada's   pride   was   thus   humbled   but, \nsince     hate     is     never     extinguished     by \nretaliation,   and   few   things   are   harder   to \nbear   than   the   pangs   of   wounded   vanity, \nhatred  of  Drona  and  a  wish  to  be  revenged  \non    him    became    the    ruling    passion    of \nDrupada's life.  \nThe    king    performed    tapas,    underwent \nfasts  and  conducted  sacrifices  in  order  to \nwin  the  gratified  gods  to  bless  him  with  a  \nson  who  should  slay  Drona  and  a  daughter  \nwho should wed Arjuna.  \nHis   efforts   were   crowned   with   success \nwith    the    birth    of    Dhrishtadyumna    who \ncommanded      the      Pandava      army      at \nKurukshetra   and,   helped   by   a   strange \ncombination    of    circumstances,    slew    the \notherwise   unconquerable  Drona,  and  birth \nof Draupadi, the consort of the Pandavas.  \n",

It   was   by   means   of   the \nsecret    help    rendered    by    Vidura    who \nwanted  to  save  the  family  from  a  great  sin,  \nthat the Pandavas escaped with their lives. \nOne  unforgivable  offence  of  the  Pandavas \nin   the   eyes   of   Duryodhana   was   that   the \npeople   of   the   city   used   to   praise   them \nopenly  and  declare  in  season  and  out  of \nseason   that   Yudhishthira   alone   was   fit   to \nbe the king.  \nThey would flock together and argue: \n\"Dhritarashtra  could  never  be  king  for  he \nwas  born  blind.  It  is  not  proper  that  he \nshould    now    hold    the    kingdom    in    his \nhands.   Bhishma   cannot   be   king   either, \nbecause  he  is  devoted  to  truth  and  to  his  \nvow  that  he  would  not  be  a  king.  Hence \nYudhishthira   alone   should be  crowned  as \nking.  He  alone  can  rule  the  Kuru  race  and  \nthe   kingdom   with   justice.\"   Thus   people \ntalked    everywhere.    These    words    were \npoison   to   Duryodhana's   ears,   and   made \nhim writhe and burn with jealousy.  \n\nHe  went  to  Dhritarashtra  and  complained \nbitterly   of   the   public   talk:   \"Father,   the \ncitizens   babble   irrelevant   nonsense.   They \nhave  no  respect  even  for  such  venerable \npersons   as   Bhishma   and   yourself.   They \nsay       that       Yudhishthira       should       be \nimmediately    crowned    king.    This    would \nbring  disaster  on  us.  You  were  set  aside \nbecause    of    your    blindness,    and    your \nbrother   became   the   king.   If   Yudhishthira \nis   to   succeed   his   father,   where   do   we \ncome?   What   chance   has   our   progeny? \nAfter   Yudhishthira   his   son,   and   his   son's \nson,   and   then   his   son   will   be   the   kings. \nWe  will  sink  into  poor  relations  dependent  \non  them  even  for  our  food.  To  live  in  hell \nwould be better than that!\"  \nAt   these   words,   Dhritarashtra   began   to \nponder   and   said:   \"Son,   what   you   say   is \ntrue.  Still  Yudhishthira  will  not  stray  from \nthe   path   of   virtue.   He   loves   all.   He  has \ntruly   inherited   all   the   excellent   virtues   of \nhis  deceased  father.  People  praise  him  and  \nwill   support   him,   and   all   the   ministers   of \nthe   State   and   commanders   of   armies,   to \nwhom  Pandu  had  endeared  himself  by  his \nnobility   of   character,   will   surely   espouse \nhis  cause.  As  for  the  people,  they  idolise \nthe   Pandavas.   We   cannot   oppose   them \nwith   any   chance   of   success.   If   we   do \ninjustice,      the      citizens      will      rise      in \ninsurrection  and  either  kill  us  or  expel  us. \nWe    shall    only    cover    ourselves    with \nignominy.\"  \nDuryodhana     replied:     \"Your     fears     are \nbaseless.  Bhishma  will  at  worst  be  neutral,  \nwhile    Ashwatthama    is    devoted    to    me, \nwhich   means   that   his   father   Drona   and \nuncle   Kripa   will   also   be   on   our   side. \nVidura  cannot  openly  oppose  us,  if  for  no  \nother   reason,   because   he   has   not   the \nstrength.   Send   the   Pandavas   immediately \nto  Varanavata.  I  tell  you  the  solemn  truth \nthat  my  cup  of  suffering  is  full  and  I  can \nbear   no   more.   It   pierces   my   heart   and \nrenders  me  sleepless  and  makes  my  life  a  \ntorment.   After   sending   the   Pandavas   to \nVaranavata  we  shall  try  to  strengthen  our \nparty.\"  \nLater,    some    politicians    were    prevailed \nupon    to    join    Duryodhana's    party    and \nadvise  the  king  in  the  matter.  Kanika,  the \nminister   of   Sakuni,   was   their   leader.   \"O \nking,\"   he   said,   \"guard   yourselves   against \nthe  sons  of  Pandu,  for  their  goodness  and  \ninfluence  are  a  menace  to  you  and  yours. \nThe    Pandavas    are    the    sons    of    your \nbrother,  but  the  nearer  the  kin,  the  closer \nand   deadlier   the   danger.   They   are   very \nstrong.\"  \nSakuni's     minister     continued:     \"Be     not \nwroth  with  me  if  I  say  a  king  should  be \nmighty   in   action   as   in   name,   for   nobody \nwill   believe   in   strength   which   is   never \ndisplayed.   State   affairs   should   be   kept \nsecret   and   the   earliest   indication   to   the \npublic,   of   a   wise   plan,   should   be   its \nexecution.   Also,   evils   must   be   eradicated \npromptly    for    a    thorn    which    has    been \nallowed  to  remain  in  the  body  may  cause \na     festering     wound.     Powerful     enemies \nshould  be  destroyed  and  even  a  weak  foe  \nshould   not   be   neglected   since   a   mere \nspark,  if  over  looked,  may  cause  a  forest  \nfire.  A  strong  enemy  should  be  destroyed  \nby   means   of   stratagem   and   it   would   be \nfolly  to  show  mercy  to  him.  O  king,  guard  \nyourself   against   the   sons   of   Pandu.   They \nare very powerful.\" \nDuryodhana     told     Dhritarashtra     of     his \nsuccess    in    securing    adherents:    \"I    have \nbought     the     goodwill     of     the     king's \nattendants  with  gifts  of  wealth  and  honor. \nI   have   won   over   his   ministers   to   our \ncause.  If  you  will  adroitly  prevail  upon  the  \nPandavas  to  go  to  Varanavata,  the  city  and  \nthe   whole   kingdom   will   take   our   side. \nThey  will  not  have  a  friend  left  here.  Once  \nthe  kingdom  has  become  ours,  there  will \nbe  no  power  for  harm  left  in  them,  and  it  \nmay   even   be   possible   to   let   them   come \nback.\" \n\nWhen  many  began  to  say  what  he  himself \nwished    to    believe,    Dhritarashtra's    mind \nwas   shaken   and   he   yielded   to   his   sons' \ncounsels.   It   only   remained   to   give   effect \nto the plot.  \nThe   ministers   began   to   praise   the   beauty \nof    Varanavata    in    the    hearing    of    the \nPandavas   and   made   mention   of   the   fact \nthat   a   great   festival   in   honor   of   Siva \nwould  be  conducted  there  with  all  pomp \nand splendor.  \nThe    unsuspecting    Pandavas    were    easily \npersuaded,   especially   when   Dhritarashtra \nalso  told  them  in  tones  of  great  affection \nthat   they   should   certainly   go   and   witness \nthe  festivities,  not  only  because  they  were \nworth  seeing  but  because  the  people  of  the \nplace were eager to welcome them.  \nThe  Pandavas  took  leave  of  Bhishma  and \nother    elders    and    went    to    Varanavata. \nDuryodhana   was   elated.   He   plotted   with \nKarna   and   Sakuni   to   kill   Kunti   and   her \nsons     at     Varanavata.     They     sent     for \nPurochana,    a    minister,    and    gave    him \nsecret     instructions     which     he     bound \nhimself to carry out faithfully.  \nBefore     the     Pandavas     proceeded     to \nVaranavata,     Purochana,     true     to     his \ninstructions,   hastened   to   the   spot   well   in \nadvance   and   had   a   beautiful   palace   built \nfor   their   reception.   Combustible   materials \nlike  jute,  lac,  ghee,  oil,  and  fat  were  used  \nin   the   construction   of   the   palace.   The \nmaterials   for   the   plastering   of   the   walls \nwere   also   inflammable.   He   skilfully   filled \nup  various  parts  of  the  building  with  dry \nthings  that  could  catch  fire  easily,  and  had  \ninviting   seats   and   bedsteads   disposed   at \nthe most combustible places.  \nEvery   convenience   was   furnished   for   the \nPandavas  to  dwell  in  the  city  without  fear,  \nuntil    the    palace    was    built.    When    the \nPandavas   had   settled   down   in   the   wax \nhouse,  the  idea  was  to  set  fire  to  it  at  night  \nwhen they were sound asleep.  \nThe   ostentatious   love   and   solicitude   with \nwhich   the   Pandavas   had   been   received \nand   treated   would   obviate   all   suspicion \nand  the  fire  would  be  taken  as  a  sad  case  \nof  pure  accident.  No  one  would  dream  of  \nblaming the Kauravas. \n",

      "content": "\nPANDAVAS \nAFTER   taking   reverential   leave   of   the \nelders  and  embracing  their  comrades,  the \nPandavas   proceeded   to   Varanavata.   The \ncitizens  accompanied  them  a  part  of  their \nway   and   returned   unwillingly   to   the   city. \nVidura   pointedly   warned   Yudhishthira   in \nwords intelligible only to the prince: \n\"He   alone   will   escape   from   danger   who \nforestalls    the    intentions    of    an    astute \nenemy.   There   are   weapons   sharper   than \nthose   made   of   steel.   And   the   wise   man \nwho  would  escape destruction  must  know \nthe   means   to   guard   against   them.   The \nconflagration     that     devastates     a     forest \ncannot  hurt  a  rat  which  shelters  itself  in  a  \nhole  or  a  porcupine  which  burrows  in  the  \nearth.   The   wise   man   knows   his   bearings \nby looking at the stars.\"  \nThough  they  had  started  on  their  journey \nin  sunshine  of  joy,  they  now  proceeded  in \na dark cloud of sorrow and anxiety.  \nThe    people    of    Varanavata    were    very \nhappy   to   learn   of   the   coming   of   the \nPandavas    to    their    city    and    welcomed \nthem.   After   a   brief   stay   in   other   houses \nwhile  the  palace  specially  meant  for  them \nwas  being  got  ready,  they  moved  into  it \nunder Purochana's guidance.  \nIt    was    named    \"Sivam\"    which    means \nprosperity,  and  that  was  the  name  which, \nin     ghastly     irony,     was     given     to     the \ndeathtrap.           Yudhishthira           diligently \nexamined  the  whole  place  bearing  in  mind  \nVidura's    warning    and    verified    that    the \nbuilding   was   without   a   shadow   of   doubt \nconstructed with combustible material.  \nYudhishthira    told    Bhima:    \"Though    we \nknow  very  well  that  the  palace  is  a  trap  of  \n\ndeath,   we   should   not   make   Purochana \nsuspect  that  we  know  his  plot.  We  should  \nget  away  at  the  right  moment  but  escape \nwould  be  difficult  if  we  gave  room  for  any  \nsuspicion.\" \nSo    they    stayed    in    that    house    to    all \nappearance   free   from   care.   Meanwhile, \nVidura  had  sent  an  expert  miner  who  met  \nthem  in  secret  and  said:  \"My  password  is  \nthe   veiled   warning   Vidura   gave   you.   I \nhave   been   sent   to   help   you   for   your \nprotection.\"  \nThis      was      meant      to      indicate      to \nYudhishthira       and       to       him       alone, \nDuryodhana's  hideous  plot  and  the  means \nof     escape     from     danger.     Yudhishthira \nanswered   that   he   had   grasped   Vidura's \nmeaning,  and  later  he  communicated  it  to \nKuntidevi.  \nHenceforward  the  miner  worked  for  many \ndays   in   secret,   unknown   to   Purochana, \nand  completed  a  subterranean  egress  from \nthe  wax  house  right  under  and  across  the  \nwalls  and  the  moat,  which  ran  round  the \nprecincts. \nPurochana  had  his  quarters  at  the  gateway \nof  the  palace.  The  Pandavas  kept  armed \nvigil  during  night,  but  by  day  they  used  to  \ngo    out    hunting    in    the    forest,    to    all \nappearance  bent  on  pleasure  but  really  to  \nmake   themselves   familiar   with   the   forest \npaths.  \nAs   has   already   been   said,   they   carefully \nkept  to  themselves  their  knowledge  of  the  \nwicked  plot  against  their  lives.  On  his  side  \nPurochana,   anxious   to   lull   all   suspicion \nand   make   the   murderous   fire   seem   an \naccident,    waited    fully    a    year    before \nputting the plot into effect. \nAt  last  Purochana  felt  he  had  waited  long \nenough.    And    the    watchful    Yudhishthira, \nknowing    that    the    fated    moment    had \narrived,   called   his   brothers   together   and \ntold  them  that  now  or  never  was  the  time  \nfor them to escape. \nKuntidevi  arranged  a  sumptuous  feast  for \nthe  attendants  that  day.  Her  idea  was  to \nlull them to well-fed sleep at night. \nAt  midnight,  Bhima  set  fire  to  the  palace \nin    several    places.    Kuntidevi    and    the \nPandava   brothers   hurried   out   through   the \nsubterranean   passage,   groping   their   way \nout  in  the  darkness.  Presently,  there  was  a  \nroaring  fire  all  over  the  palace  and  a  fast \nswelling   crowd   of   frightened   citizens   all \naround in loud and helpless lamentation.  \nSome   bustled  aimlessly  in  futile  efforts  to \nput  out  the  conflagration  and  all  joined  in \nthe    cry:    \"Alas!    Alas!    This    surely    is \nDuryodhana's   work,   and   he   is   killing   the \nsinless Pandavas!\" \nThe     palace     was     reduced     to     ashes. \nPurochana's   residence   was   enveloped   in \nflames  before  he  could  escape  and  he  fell \nan unpitied victim to his own wicked plot.  \nThe    people    of    Varanavata,    sent    the \nfollowing    message    to    Hastinapura:    \"The \npalace    which    was    the    abode    of    the \nPandavas  has  burnt  down  and  no  one  in  it  \nescaped alive.\" \nVyasa   has   beautifully   described   the   then \nmental  state  of  Dhritarashtra:  \"Just  as  the \nwater  of  a  deep  pool  is  cool  at  the  bottom  \nand  warm  on  the  surface,  so  the  heart  of \nDhritarashtra  was  at  once  warm  with  joy \nand chilled with sorrow.\"  \nDhritarashtra   and   his   sons   cast   off their \nroyal   garments   in   token   of   mourning   for \nthe      Pandavas      whom      they      believed \nconsumed    in    the    fire.    They    dressed \nthemselves   in   single   garments   as   became \nsorrowful   kinsmen   and   went   to   the   river \nand    performed    the    propitiatory    funeral \nrites.  \nNo     outward     show of    heart    broken \nbereavement  was  omitted.  It  was  noticed \nby  some  that  Vidura  was  not  so  overcome  \nby  sorrow  as  the  others  and  this  was  set \ndown   to   his   philosophical   bent   of   mind. \nBut  the  real  reason  was  that  he  knew  that  \nthe Pandavas had escaped to safety. \n\nWhen   he   looked   sad,   he   was   in   fact \nfollowing   with   his   mind's   eye   the   weary \nwanderings   of   the   Pandavas.   Seeing   that \nBhishma    was    sunk    in    sorrow,    Vidura \nsecretly   comforted   him   by   revealing   to \nhim the story of their successful escape. \nBhima   saw   that   his   mother and   brothers \nwere   exhausted   by   their   nightly   vigils   as \nwell  as  by  fear  and  anxiety.  He  therefore \ncarried   his   mother   on   his   shoulders   and \ntook   Nakula   and   Sahadeva   on   his   hips, \nsupporting   Yudhishthira   and   Arjuna   with \nhis two hands. \nThus   heavily   laden,   he   strode   effortlessly \nlike   a   lordly   elephant   forcing   his   way \nthrough   the   forest   and   pushing   aside   the \nshrubs and trees that obstructed his path.  \nWhen  they  reached  the  Ganges,  there  was  \na   boat   ready   for   them   in   charge   of   a \nboatman   who   knew   their   secret.   They \ncrossed   the   river   in   the   darkness,   and \nentering   a   mighty   forest   they   went   on   at \nnight  in  darkness  that  wrapped  them  like  a  \nshroud  and  in  a  silence  broken  hideously \nby the frightful noises of wild animals. \nAt   last,   quite   fordone   by   toil,   they   sat \ndown   unable to   bear   the   pangs   of   thirst \nand  overcome  by  the  drowsiness  of  sheer  \nfatigue.   Kuntidevi   said:   \"I   do   not   care \neven  if  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra  are  here \nto  seize  me,  but  I  must  stretch  my  legs.\" \nShe   forthwith   laid   herself   down   and   was \nsunk in sleep.  \nBhima   forced   his   way   about   the   tangled \nforest  in  search  of  water  in  the  darkness. \nAnd  finding  a  pool,  he  wetted  his  upper \ngarment,   made   cups   of   lotus   leaves   and \nbrought  water  to  his  mother  and  brothers \nwho were perishing with thirst.  \nThen,   while   the   others   slept   in   merciful \nforgetfulness   of   their   woes,   Bhima   alone \nsat  awake  absorbed  in  deep  thought.  \"Do  \nnot   the   plants   and   the   creepers   of   the \nforest  mutually  help  each  other  and  live  in \npeace?\"    he    reflected;    \"why    should    the \nwicked   Dhritarashtra   and   Duryodhana   try \nto    injure    us    in    these    ways?\"    Sinless \nhimself,   Bhima   could   not   understand   the \nsprings   of   sinfulness   in   others   and   was \nlost in grief. \nThe     Pandavas     marched     on,     suffering \nmany    hardships    and    overcoming    many \ndangers.  Part  of  the  way,  they  would  carry  \ntheir     mother    to    make    better    speed. \nSometimes,    tired    beyond    even    heroic \nendurance,   they   would   pause   and   rest. \nSometimes,   full   of   life   and   the   glorious \nstrength   of   youth,   they   would   race   with \neach other. \nThey   met   Bhagavan   Vyasa   on   the   way. \nAll    of    them    bowed    before    him    and \nreceived  encouragement  and  wise  counsel \nfrom him. \nWhen  Kunti  told  him  of  the  sorrows  that \nhad   befallen   them,   Vyasa   consoled   her \nwith   these   words:   \"No   virtuous   man   is \nstrong  enough  to  live  in  virtue  at  all  times,  \nnor  is  any  sinner  bad  enough  to  exist  in \none  welter  of  sin.  Life  is  a  tangled  web \nand  there  is  no  one  in  the  world  who  has  \nnot   done   both   good   and   evil.   Each   and \neveryone  has  to  bear  the  consequence  of \nhis actions. Do not give way to sorrow.\"  \nThen  they  put  on  the  garb  of  brahmanas, \nas  advised  by Vyasa,  went  to  the  city  of \nEkachakra     and     stayed     there     in     a \nbrahmana's house, waiting for better days. \n",

And \nhowever   much   it   might   eat,   its   hunger   is \nnever quite satisfied.  \nBhima's   insatiable   hunger   and   the   scanty \nfood  he  used  to  get  at  Ekachakra  went  ill \ntogether.   And   he   daily   grew   thin,   which \ncaused   much   distress   to   his   mother   and \nbrothers.   Sometime   later,   Bhima   became \nacquainted   with   a   potter   for   whom   he \nhelped   and   fetched   clay.   The   potter,   in \nreturn,   presented   him   with   a   big   earthen \npot  that  became  an  object  of  merriment  to  \nthe street urchins.  \nOne   day,   when   the   other   brothers   had \ngone   to   beg   for   alms,   Bhimasena   stayed \nbehind   with   his   mother,   and   they   heard \nloud  lamentations  from  the  house  of  their \nbrahmana   landlord.   Some   great   calamity \nsurely   had   befallen   the   poor   family   and \nKunti went inside to learn what it was.  \nThe   brahmana   and   his   wife   could  hardly \nspeak    for    weeping,    but,    at    last    the \nbrahmana  said  to  his  wife:  \"O  unfortunate \nand  foolish  woman,  though  time  and  again \nI   wished   we   should   leave   this   city   for \ngood,  you  would  not  agree.  You  persisted  \nin   saying   that   you   were   born   and   bred \nhere  and  here  you  would  stay  where  your  \nparents  and  relations  had  lived  and  died. \nHow  can  I  think  of  losing  you  who  have \nbeen  to  me  at  once  my  life's  mate,  loving \nmother,   the   wife   who   bore   my   children, \nnay,  my  all  in  all?  I  cannot  send  you  to \ndeath  while  I  keep  myself  alive.  This  little  \ngirl  has  been  given  to  us  by  God  as  a  trust  \nto   be   handed   over   in   time   to   a   worthy \nman.  It  is  unrighteous  to  sacrifice  her  who  \nis  a  gift  of  God  to  perpetuate  the  race.  It  is  \nequally  impossible  to  allow  this  other,  our \nson,  to  be  killed.  How  can  we  live  after \nconsigning  to  death  our  only  solace  in  life \nand  our  hope  for  the  here  after?  If  he  is \nlost,  who  would  pour  libations  for  us  and \nour  ancestors?  Alas!  You  did  not  pay  heed  \nto  my  words,  and  this  is  the  deadly  fruit  of  \nyour  perversity.  If  I  give  up  my  life,  this \ngirl  and  boy  will  surely  die  soon  for  want  \nof  a  protector.  What  shall  I  do?  It  is  best  \nthat   all   of   us   perish   together\"   and   the \nbrahmana burst forth sobbing. \nThe   wife   replied:   \"I   have   been   a   good \nwife  to  you,  and  done  my  duty  by  bearing  \nyou  a  daughter  and  a  son.  You  are  able, \nand  I  am  not,  to  bring  up  and  protect  your  \nchildren.  Just  as  cast  out  offal  is  pounced \nupon  and  seized  by  rapacious  birds,  a  poor  \nwidowed    woman    is    an    easy    prey    to \nwicked   and   dishonest   people.   Dogs   fight \nfor  a  cloth  wet  with  ghee,  and  in  pulling  it  \nhither  and  thither  in  unclean  greed,  tear  it \ninto   foul   rags.   It   would   be   best   if   I   am \nhanded   over   to   the   Rakshasa.   Blessed \nindeed   is   the   woman   who   passes   to   the \nother   world,   while   her   husband   is   alive. \nThis,  as  you  know,  is  what  the  scriptures  \nsay.   Bid   me   farewell.   Take   care   of   my \nchildren.   I   have   been   happy   with   you.   I \nhave   performed   many   meritorious   actions. \nBy  my  faithful  devotion  to  you,  I  am  sure  \nof   heaven.   Death   has   no   terror   for   one \nwho   has   been   a   good   wife. After  I  am \ngone,  take  another  wife.  Gladden  me  with \na  brave  smile,  give  me  your  blessing,  and \nsend me to the Rakshasa.\" \nHearing    these    words    of    his    wife,    the \nbrahmana    tenderly    embraced    her    and, \nutterly  overcome  by  her  love  and  courage,  \nhe  wept  like  a  child.  When  he  could  find  \nhis   voice,   he   replied:   \"O   beloved   and \nnoble  one,  what  words  are  these?  Can  I \nbear  to  live  without  you?  The  first  duty  of \na   married   man   is   to   protect   his   wife.   I \nshould  indeed  be  a  pitiful  sinner  if  I  lived \nafter    giving    you    up    to    the    Rakshasa, \nsacrificing both love and duty.\"  \nThe    daughter    who    was    hearing    this \npiteous  conversation,  now  interposed  with \nsobs:  \"Listen  to  me,  child  though  I  be,  and  \nthen  do  what  is  proper.  It  is  me  alone  that  \nyou    can    spare    to    the    Rakshasa.    By \n\nsacrificing   one   soul,   that   is,   myself,   you \ncan  save  the  others.  Let  me  be  the  little \nboat   to   take   you   across   this   river   of \ncalamity.     In     like     manner,     a     woman \nwithout  a  guardian  becomes  the  sport  of \nwicked   people   who   drag   her   hither   and \nthither.  It  is  impossible  for  me  to  protect \ntwo    fatherless    orphans    and    they    will \nperish   miserably   like   fish   in   a   waterless \npond.  If  both  of  you  pass  away,  both  I  and  \nthis   little   baby   brother   of   mine   will   soon \nperish   unprotected   in   this   hard   world.   If \nthis   family   of   ours   can   be   saved   from \ndestruction   by   my   single   death,   what   a \ngood   death   mine   would   be!   Even   if   you \nconsider   my   welfare   alone,   you   should \nsend me to the Rakshasa.\" \nAt  these  brave  words  of  the  poor  child,  the  \nparents  tenderly  embraced  her  and  wept. \nSeeing   them   all   in   tears   the   boy,   hardly \nmore  than  a  baby,  started  up  with  glowing \neyes,    lisping:    \"Father,    do    not    weep. \nMother,   do   not   weep.   Sister,   do   not \nweep,\"  and  he  went  to  each  and  sat  on \ntheir lap by turns.  \nThen  he  rose  up  took  a  stick  of  firewood  \nand  brandishing  it  about,  said  in  his  sweet  \nchildish   treble:   \"I   shall   kill   the   Rakshasa \nwith   this   stick.\"   The   child's   action   and \nspeech   made   them   smile   in   the   midst   of \ntheir  tears,  but  only  added  to  their  great \nsorrow.  \nFeeling     this     was     the     moment     for \nintervention,      Kuntidevi      entered      and \ninquired  for  the  cause  of  their  sorrow  and  \nwhether  there  was  anything  she  could  do \nto help them.  \nThe   brahmana   said:   \"Mother,   this   is   a \nsorrow   far   beyond   your   aid.   There   is   a \ncave  near  the  city,  where  lives  a  cruel  and  \nterribly  strong  Rakshasa  named  Bakasura. \nHe   forcibly   seized   this   city   and   kingdom \nthirteen  years  ago.  Since  then  he  has  held  \nus   in   cruel   thraldom.   The   kshatriya   ruler \nof   this   country   has   fled   to   the   city   of \nVetrakiya  and  is  unable  to  protect  us.  This  \nRakshasa  formerly  used  to  issue  from  his \ncave whenever   he   liked   and,   mad   with \nhunger,   indiscriminately   kill   and   eat   men, \nwomen    and    children    in    this    city.    The \ncitizens  prayed  to  the  Rakshasa  to  come  to  \nsome   sort   of   stipulation   in   place   of   this \npromiscuous   slaughter.   They   prayed:   'Do \nnot   kill   us   wantonly   at   your   whim   and \npleasure.  Once  a  week  we  shall  bring  you \nsufficient       meat,       rice,       curds       and \nintoxicating     liquors     and     many     other \ndelicacies.  We  will  deliver  these  to  you  in \na  carriage  drawn  by  two  bullocks  driven \nby  a  human  being  taken  from  each  house \nin  turn.  You  can  make  a  repast  of  the  rice,  \nalong  with  the  bullocks  and  the  man,  but \nrefrain   from   this   mad   orgy   of   slaughter.' \nThe   Rakshasa   agreed   to   the   proposal. \nFrom   that   day,   this   strong   Rakshasa   has \nbeen  protecting  this  kingdom  from  foreign \nraids   and   wild   beasts.   This   arrangement \nhas  been  in  force  for  many  years.  No  hero  \nhas  been  found  to  free  this  country  from \nthis  pest,  for  the  Rakshasa  has  invariably \ndefeated  and  killed  all  the  brave  men  who  \ntried.   Mother,   our   legitimate   sovereign   is \nunable   to   protect   us.   The   citizens   of   a \ncountry,   whose   king   is   weak,   should   not \nmarry    and    beget    children.    A    worthy \nfamily    life,    with    culture    and    domestic \nhappiness,  is  possible  only  under  the  rule \nof  a  good,  strong  king.  Wife,  wealth  and \nother   things   are   not   safe,   if   there   be  no \nproper   king   ruling   over   us.   And   having \nlong   suffered   with   the   sight   of   others' \nsorrow,  our  own  turn  has  come  now  to \nsend  a  person  as  prey  to  the  Rakshasa.  I  \nhave    not    the    means    to    purchase    a \nsubstitute.   None   of   us   can   bear   to   live \nafter  sending  one  of us  to  a  cruel  death, \nand  so  I  shall  go  with  my  whole  family  to  \nhim.  Let  the  wicked  glutton  gorge  himself \nwith   all   of   us.   I   have   pained   you   with \nthese   things,   but   you   wished   to   know. \nOnly  God  can  help  us,  but  we  have  lost  all  \nhope even of that.\" \n\nThe  political  truths  contained  in  this  story \nof      Ekachakra      are      noteworthy      and \nsuggestive.   Kunti   talked   the   matter   over \nwith    Bhimasena    and    returned    to    the \nbrahmana.  She  said:  \"Good  man,  do  not \ndespair.   God   is   great.   I   have   five   sons. \nOne   of   them   will   take   the   food   to   the \nRakshasa.\" \nThe    brahmana    jumped    up    in    amazed \nsurprise,   but   then   shook   his   head   sadly \nand   would   not   hear   of   the   substituted \nsacrifice.  Kunti  said:  \"O  brahmana,  do  not  \nbe    afraid.    My    son    is    endowed    with \nsuperhuman  powers  derived  from  mantras \nand   will   certainly  kill  this  Rakshasa,  as  I \nhave    myself    seen    him    kill    many    other \nsuch   Rakshasas.   But   keep   this   a   secret, \nfor,  if  you  reveal  it,  his  power  will  come \nto naught.\" \nKunti's   fear   was   that,   if   the   story   got \nnoised   abroad,   Duryodhana's   men   would \nsee  the  hand  of  the  Pandavas,  and  find  out  \ntheir  where  abouts.  Bhima  was  filled  with \nunbounded    joy    and    enthusiasm    at    the \narrangement made by Kunti.  \nThe  other  brothers  returned  to  the  house \nwith   alms.   Dharmaputra   saw   the   face   of \nBhimasena   radiant   with   joy   to   which   it \nhad  long  been  a  stranger  and  inferred  that  \nhe    was    resolved    on    some    hazardous \nadventure  and  questioned  Kunti  who  told \nhim everything. \nYudhishthira   said:   \"What   is   this?   Is   not \nthis    rash    and    thoughtless?    Relying    on \nBhima's  strength  we  sleep  without  care  or  \nfear.   It   is   not   through   Bhima's   strength \nand   daring   that   we   hope   to   regain   the \nkingdom   that   has   been   seized   by   our \ndeceitful  enemies?  Was  it  not  through  the \nprowess  of  Bhima  that  we  escaped  from \nthe  wax  palace?  And  you  are  risking  the \nlife     of     Bhima     who     is     our     present \nprotection   and   future   hope.   I   fear   your \nmany trials have clouded your judgment!\" \nKuntidevi   replied:   \"Dear   sons,   we   have \nlived  happily  for  many  years  in  the  house \nof  this  brahmana.  Duty,  nay,  man's  highest  \nvirtue,   is   to   repay   the   benefit   he   has \nenjoyed  by  doing  good  in  his  turn.  I  know  \nthe  heroism  of  Bhima  and  have  no  fears. \nRemember      who      carried      us      from \nVaranavata   and   who   killed   the   demon \nHidimba.  It  is  our  duty  to  be  of  service  to  \nthis brahmana family.\" \nAfter     a     fierce     battle,     the     Rakshasa \nBakasura     was slain     by     Bhima     who \npretended to bring him a cartload of food. \n",

Let  us  therefore  go  to  \nDrupada's  kingdom  which  is  reputed  to  be  \nfair  and  prosperous.\"  Kunti  was  second  to  \nnone  in  worldly  wisdom  and  sagacity  and \ncould   gracefully   divine   her   sons'   thoughts \nand    spare    them    the    awkwardness    of \nexpressing them.  \nThe  brahmanas  went  in  groups  to  witness \nthe     swayamvara     and     the     Pandavas \nmingled     with     them     in     the     guise     of \nbrahmanas.  After  a  long  march  the  party \nreached  the  beautiful  city  of  Drupada  and \nbilleted    themselves    in    the    house    of    a \npotter as obscure brahmanas of no note. \nThough     Drupada     and     Drona     were \noutwardly    at    peace,    the    former    never \ncould   forget   or   forgive   the   humiliation   he \n\nhad     suffered     at     the     latter's     hands. \nDrupada's    one    wish    was    to    give    his \ndaughter in marriage to Arjuna.  \nDrona   loved   Arjuna   so   dearly   that   he \ncould  hardly  look  upon  his  pupil's  father-\nin-law  as  his  deadly  foe.  And  if  there  were  \na  war,  Drupada  would  be  all  the  stronger  \nfor  being  Arjuna's  father-in-law.  When  he \nheard  the  news  of  the  destruction  of  the \nPandavas  at  Varanavata,  he  was  plunged \nin   sorrow but   was   relieved   by   a   later \nrumour that they had escaped.  \nThe      marriage      hall      was      beautifully \ndecorated   and   built   amidst   a   finely   laid \nout   group   of   new   guest-houses   designed \nto   accommodate   the   swayamvara   suitors \nand   guests.   Attractive   sights   and   sports \nhad been       arranged       for       public \nentertainment    and    there    were    glorious \nfestivities for fourteen days continuously. \nA   mighty   steel   bow   was   placed   in   the \nmarriage    hall.    The    candidate    for    the \nprincess'  hand  was  required  to  string  the \nbow   and   with   it   shoot   a   steel   arrow \nthrough  the  central  aperture  of  a  revolving \ndisk at a target placed on high.  \nThis   required   almost   superhuman   strength \nand  skill,  and  Drupada  proclaimed  that  the  \nhero  who  would  win  his  daughter  should \nperform   this   feat.   Many   valiant   princes \nhad    gathered    there    from    all    parts    of \nBharatavarsha.   The   sons   of   Dhritarashtra \nwere   there   as   well   as   Karna,   Krishna, \nSisupala, Jarasandha, and Salya.  \nBesides  the  competitors  there  was  a  huge \nconcourse  of  spectators  and  visitors.  The \nnoise  that  issued  therefrom  resembled  the \nuproar  of  the  ocean  and  over  it  all  arose \nthe  auspicious  sound  of  festal  music  from \nhundreds of instruments.  \nDhrishtadyumna    on    horseback    rode    in \nfront  of  his  sister  Draupadi  seated  on  an \nelephant.  Fresh  from  her  auspicious  bridal \nbath,   and   clad   in flowing   silk   Draupadi \ndismounted   and   entered   the   swayamvara \nhall,   seeming   to   fill   it   with   the   sweetness \nof her presence and perfect beauty.  \nGarland  in  hand,  and  coyly  glancing  at  the  \nvaliant  princes,  who  for  their  part  looked \nat    her    in    speechless    admiration,    she \nascended     the     dais.     The     brahmanas \nrepeated   the   usual   mantras   and   offered \noblations    in    the    fire.    After    the    peace \ninvocation    had    been    chanted    and    the \nflourish       of       music       had       stopped, \nDhrishtadyumna    took    Draupadi    by    the \nhand and led her to the center of the hall.  \nThen   he   proclaimed   in   loud,   clear   tones: \n\"Hear  ye,  O  princes  seated  in  state  in  this  \nassembly,   here   is   the   bow.   There   is   the \ntarget  and  here  are  the  arrows.  He  who \nsends   five   arrows   in   succession   through \nthe   hole   of   the   wheel   and   unerringly   hits \nthe  target,  if  he  also  be  of  good  family  and  \npresence,   shall   win   my   sister.\"   Then   he \nnarrated   to   Draupadi   the   name,   ancestry \nand    description    of    the    several    suitors \nassembled there. \nMany  noted  princes  rose  one  after  another  \nand  tried  in  vain  to  string  the  bow.  It  was  \ntoo   heavy   and   stiff   for   them,   and   they \nreturned    to    their    places    abashed    and \nashamed.  \nSisupala,        Jarasandha,        Salya,        and \nDuryodhana        were        among        these \nunsuccessful  aspirants.  When  Karna  came \nforward,  all  the  assemblage  expected  that \nhe   would   be   successful   but   he   failed   by \njust   a   hair's   breadth   and   the   string   slid \nback  flashing  and  the  mighty  bow  jumped \nout of his hands like a thing of life.  \nThere   was   great   clamor   and   angry   talk, \nsome     even     saying     that     it     was     an \nimpossible  test  put  up  to  shame  the  kings. \nThen   all   noises   were   hushed,   for   there \narose  from  among  the  group  of  brahmanas  \na youth who advanced towards the bow.  \nIt  was  Arjuna  who  had  come  disguised  as  \na   brahmana.   When   he   stood   up;   wild \nclamor  burst  forth  again  from  the  crowd.  \nThe   brahmanas   themselves   were   divided \n\nin   opinion.   Some   being   highly   delighted \nthat  there  should  be  among  them  a  lad  of \nmettle   enough   to   compete,   while   others \nmore  envious  or  worldly  wise,  said  what \nimpudence  it  was  for  this  brahmacharin  to  \nenter   the   lists   when   heroes   like   Karna, \nSalya, and others had met with failure.  \nBut   there   were   others   again   who   spoke \ndifferently   as   they   noted   the   noble   and \nshapely   proportions   of   the   youth.   They \nsaid:  \"We  feel  from  his  appearance  that  he  \nis  going  to  win.  He  looks  sure  of  himself \nand  he  certainly  knows  what  he  is  about. \nThe  brahmana  may  be  physically  weaker, \nbut   is   it   all   a   matter   of   brute   strength? \nWhat  about  the  power  of  austerities?  Why \nshould he not try?\" And they blessed him.  \nArjuna   approached   the   place   where   the \nbow  lay  and  asked  Dhrishtadyumna:  \"Can \na brahmana try to bend the bow?\" \nDhrishtadyumna    answered:    \"O    best    of \nbrahmanas,  my  sister  will  become  the  life-\nmate   of   any   one   of   good   family   and \npresence,  who  bends  the  bow  and  shoots  \nthe  target.  My  words  stand  and  there  will \nbe no going back on them.\" \nThen   Arjuna   meditated   on   Narayana,   the \nSupreme   God,   and   took   the   bow   in   his \nhand  and  strung  it  with  ease.  He  placed  an  \narrow  on  the  string  and  looked  around  him  \nwith  a  smile,  while  the  crowd  was  lost  in \nspellbound silence.  \nThen   without  pause  or  hesitation  he  shot \nfive    arrows    in    succession    through    the \nrevolving   mechanism   right   into   the   target \nso   that   it   fell   down.   The   crowd   was   in \ntumult   and   there   was   a   blare   of   musical \ninstruments. \nThe   brahmanas   who   were   seated   in   the \nassembly    in    large numbers    sent    forth \nshouts   of   joy,   waving   aloft   their   deer-\nskins   in   exultation   as   though   the   whole \ncommunity     had     won     Draupadi.     The \nuproar that followed was indescribable.  \nDraupadi  shone  with  a  fresh  beauty.  Her \nface      glowed      with      happiness      which \nstreamed  out  of  her  eyes  as  she  looked  on  \nArjuna.   She   approached   him   and   placed \nthe    garland    on    his    neck.    Yudhishthira, \nNakula,  and  Sahadeva  returned  in  haste  to  \nthe  potter's  house  to  convey  the  glad  news  \nimmediately to their mother.  \nBhima   alone   remained   in   the   assembly \nfearing    that    some    danger    might    befall \nArjuna  from  the  kshatriyas.  As  anticipated \nby  Bhima,  the  princes  were  loud  in  wrath.  \nThey   said:   \"The   practice   of   swayamvara, \nthe    choosing    of    a    bridegroom,    is    not \nprevalent   among   the   brahmanas.   If   this \nmaiden  does  not  care  to  marry  a  prince, \nshe    should    remain    a    virgin    and    burn \nherself  on  the  pyre.  How  can  a  brahmana  \nmarry    her?    We    should    oppose    this \nmarriage  and  prevent  it  so  as  to  protect \nrighteousness   and   save   the   practice   of \nswayamvara      from      the      peril      which \nthreatens     it.\"     A     free     fight     seemed \nimminent.  \nBhima   plucked   a   tree   by   the   roots,   and \nstripping   it   of   foliage,   stood   armed   with \nthis   formidable   bludgeon,   by   the   side   of \nArjuna  ready  for  any  event.  Draupadi  said  \nnothing  but  stood  holding  on  to  the  skirts \nof the deer-skin in which Arjuna was clad. \nKrishna,   Balarama   and   others   sought   to \nappease    those    who    had    created    the \nconfusion.  Arjuna  proceeded  to  the  house \nof the potter accompanied by Draupadi.  \nAs     Bhima     and     Arjuna     were     taking \nDraupadi     to     their     temporary     abode, \nDhrishtadyumna     followed     them     at     a \ndistance,   and,   unseen   by   them,   closely \nobserved  everything  that  took  place  there. \nHe  was  amazed  and  delighted  at  what  he  \nsaw,  and  returning,  he  secretly  told  King \nDrupada:   \"Father,   I   think   they   are   the \nPandavas.    Draupadi    accompanied    them, \nholding   to   the   skirts   of   the   deer-skin   of \nthat  youth  and  she  was  not  at  all  abashed.  \nI  also  followed  and  I  saw  all  five  and  a \nvenerable  and  august  lady  who,  I  have  no  \ndoubt, is Kunti herself.\"  \n\nInvited     by     Drupada     Kunti     and     the \nPandavas  went  to  the  palace.  Dharmaputra  \nconfided   to   the   king   that   they   were   the \nPandavas.   He   also   informed   him   of   their \ndecision to marry Draupadi in common.  \nDrupada   rejoiced   at   knowing   that   they \nwere  the  Pandavas,  which  set  at  rest  all \nanxiety   regarding   the   enmity   of   Drona. \nBut  he  was  surprised  and  disgusted  when \nhe   heard   that   they   would   jointly   marry \nDraupadi. \nDrupada   opposed   this   and   said:   \"How \nunrighteous!   How   did   this   idea   get   into \nyour   head,   this   immoral   idea   that   goes \nagainst the traditional usage?\"  \nYudhishthira answered:    \"O    king,    kindly \nexcuse   us.   In   a   time   of   great   peril   we \nvowed   that   we   would   share   all   things   in \ncommon  and  we  cannot  break  that  pledge.  \nOur    mother    has    commanded    us    so.\" \nFinally  Drupada  yielded  and  the  marriage \nwas celebrated. \n",

That   he   has   given   away   his \ndaughter  in  marriage  to  the  Pandavas  will \nnot  stand  in  the  way  of  our  making  him  an  \nally.    There    is    nothing    that    cannot    be \naccomplished by the power of wealth.\" \nKarna  smiled  and  said:  \"This  is  but  futile \ntalk.\"  \nDuryodhana      continued:      \"We      should \nsomehow  make  sure  that  the  Pandavas  do  \nnot   come   here   and   demand   of   us   the \nkingdom   that   is   now   in   our   possession. \nWe  may  commission  a  few  brahmanas  to \nspread   convenient   rumours   in   Drupada's \ncity   and   severally   tell   the   Pandavas   that \nthey  would  meet  with  great  danger  if  they \nwere   to   go   to   Hastinapura.   Then   the \nPandavas  would  fear  to  come  here  and  we  \nshall be safe, from them.\" \nKarna  replied:  \"This  too  is  idle  talk.  You \ncannot frighten them that way.\" \nDuryodhana     continued:     \"Can     we     not \ncreate   discord   among   the   Pandavas   by \nmeans    of    Draupadi?    Her    polyandrous \nmarriage   is   very   convenient   for   us.   We \nshall  arouse  doubts  and  jealousies  in  their \nminds  through  the  efforts  of  experts  in  the  \nscience    of    erotics.    We    shall    certainly \nsucceed.  We  can  get  a  beautiful  woman  to  \nbeguile   some   of   the   sons   of   Kunti   and \nthus  make  Draupadi  turn  against  them.  If \nDraupadi  begins  to  suspect  any  of  them, \nwe  can  invite  him  to  Hastinapura  and  use \nhim so that our plan prospers.\"  \nKarna  laughed  this  also  to  scorn.  He  said:  \n\"None  of  your  proposals  is  any  good.  You  \ncannot      conquer      the      Pandavas      by \nstratagem.  When  they  were  here  and  were  \nlike    immature    birds    with    undeveloped \nwings,   we   found   we   could   not   deceive \nthem,  and  you  think  we  can  deceive  them \nnow,  when  they  have  acquired  experience  \nand  are  moreover  under  the  protection  of \nDrupada.   They   have   seen   through   your \ndesigns.  Stratagems  will  not  do  hereafter. \nYou  cannot  sow  dissensions  among  them. \nYou  cannot  bribe  the  wise  and  honorable \nDrupada.    He    will    not    give    up    the \nPandavas   on   any   account.   Draupadi   also \ncan     never     be     turned     against     them. \nTherefore,  there  is  only  one  way  left  for \nus,  and  that  is  to  attack  them  before  they \ngrow  stronger  and  other  friends  join  them.  \nWe  should  make  a  surprise  attack  on  the  \nPandavas    and    Drupada   before   Krishna \njoins   them   with   his   Yadava   army.   We \nshould   take   the   heroic   way   out   of   our \ndifficulty,    as    befits    kshatriyas.    Trickery \nwill   prove   useless.\"   Thus   spoke   Karna. \nDhritarashtra  could  not  make  up  his  mind.  \nThe  king,  therefore,  sent  for  Bhishma  and \nDrona and consulted them.  \nBhishma  was  very  happy  when  he  heard \nthat  the  Pandavas  were  alive  and  well  as \nguests    of    King    Drupada    of    Panchala, \nwhose     daughter     they     had     married. \nConsulted    on    the    steps    to    be    taken, \nBhishma,  wise  with  the  ripe  knowledge  of \nright and wrong, replied: \n\"The   proper   course   will   be   to   welcome \nthem    back    and    give    them    half    the \nkingdom.   The   citizens   of   the   state   also \ndesire  such  a  settlement.  This  is  the  only \nway  to  maintain  the  dignity  of  our  family. \nThere  is  much  loose  talk  not  creditable  to  \nyou   about   the   fire   incident   at   the   wax \nhouse.   All   blame,   even   all   suspicion,   will \nbe  set  at  rest  if  you  invite  the  Pandavas \nand  hand  over  half  kingdom  to  them.  This  \nis my advice.\"  \nDrona   also   gave   the   same   counsel   and \nsuggested  sending  a  proper  messenger  to \nbring   about   an   amicable   settlement   and \nestablish peace. \nKarna  flew  into  a  rage  at  this  suggestion. \nHe      was      very      much      devoted      to \n\nDuryodhana  and  could  not  at  all  bear  the \nidea  of  giving  a  portion  of  the  kingdom  to  \nthe Pandavas. He told Dhritarashtra: \n\"I   am   surprised   that   Drona,   who   has \nreceived  wealth  and  honors  at  your  hands,  \nhas    made    such    a    suggestion.    A    king \nshould  examine  critically  the  advice  of  his \nministers before accepting or rejecting it.\" \nAt  these  words  of  Karna,  Drona,  his  old \neyes   full   of  anger,  said:  \"O  wicked  man, \nyou   are   advising   the   king   to   go   on   the \nwrong  path.  If  Dhritarashtra  does  not  do \nwhat   Bhishma   and   myself   have   advised, \nthe    Kauravas    will    certainly    meet    with \ndestruction in the near future.\"  \nThen   Dhritarashtra   sought   the   advice of \nVidura who replied: \n\"The  counsel  given  by  Bhishma,  the  head \nof  our  race,  and  Drona,  the  master,  is  wise  \nand   just   and   should   not   be   disregarded. \nThe  Pandavas  are  also  your  children  like \nDuryodhana  and  his  brothers.  You  should \nrealise  that  those  who  advise  you  to  injure  \nthe   Pandavas   are   really   bent   upon   the \ndestruction  of  the  race.  Drupada  and  his \nsons  as  well  as  Krishna  and  the  Yadavas \nare   staunch   allies   of   the   Pandavas.   It   is \nimpossible    to    defeat    them    in    battle. \nKarna's  advice  is  foolish  and  wrong.  It  is \nreported  abroad  that  we  tried  to  kill  the \nPandavas  in  the  wax  house,  and  we  should  \nfirst   of   all   try   to   clear   ourselves   of   the \nblame.  The  citizens  and  the  whole  country \nare  delighted  to  know  that  the  Pandavas \nare  alive  and  they  desire  to  see  them  once  \nagain.   Do   not   listen   to   the   words   of \nDuryodhana.   Karna   and   Sakuni   are   but \nraw  youths,  ignorant  of  statesmanship  and \nincompetent   to   advise.   Follow   Bhishma's \nadvice.\"  \nIn   the   end   Dhritarashtra   determined   to \nestablish     peace     by     giving     half     the \nkingdom   to   the   sons of   Pandu.   He   sent \nVidura   to   the   kingdom   of   Panchala   to \nfetch the Pandavas and Draupadi. \nVidura  went  to  the  city  of  King  Drupada \nin  a  speedy  vehicle  taking  along  with  him \nmany   kinds   of   jewels   and   other   valuable \npresents. \nVidura    rendered    due    honor    to    King \nDrupada  and  requested  him  on  behalf  of \nDhritarashtra   to   send   the   Pandavas   with \nPanchali to Hastinapura.  \nDrupada   mistrusted   Dhritarashtra,   but   he \nmerely   said:   \"The   Pandavas   may   do   as \nthey like.\" \nVidura   went   to   Kuntidevi   and   prostrated \nhimself    before    her.    She   said:   \"Son   of \nVichitravirya,   you   saved   my   sons.   They \nare,  therefore,  your  children.  I  trust  you.  I  \nshall   do   as   you   advise.\"   She   was   also \nsuspicious of Dhritarashtra's intentions. \nVidura   thus   assured   her:   \"Your   children \nwill    never    meet    with    destruction.    They \nwill  inherit  the  kingdom  and  acquire  great \nrenown.  Come,  let  us  go.\"  At  last  Drupada  \nalso  gave  his  assent  and  Vidura  returned \nto   Hastinapura   with   the   Pandavas,   Kunti, \nand Draupadi. \nIn    jubilant    welcome    of    the    beloved \nprinces   who   were   returning   home   after \nlong  years  of  exile  and  travail,  the  streets \nof   Hastinapura   had   been   sprinkled   with \nwater  and  decorated  with  flowers.  As  had  \nbeen   already   decided,   half   the   kingdom \nwas   made   over   to   the   Pandavas   and \nYudhishthira was duly crowned king. \nDhritarashtra   blessed   the   newly   crowned \nYudhishthira   and   bade   him   farewell   with \nthese  words:  \"My  brother  Pandu  made  this  \nkingdom   prosperous.   May   you   prove   a \nworthy   heir   to   his   renown!   King   Pandu \ndelighted   in   abiding   by   my   advice.   Love \nme   in   the   same   manner.   My   sons   are \nwicked and    proud.    I    have    made    this \nsettlement  so  that  there  may  be  no  strife  or  \nhatred        between        you.        Go        to \nKhandavaprastha     and     make     it     your \ncapital.       Our       ancestors       Pururavas, \nNahusha,   and   Yayati   ruled   the   kingdom \nfrom  there.  That  was  our  ancient  capital. \n\nRe-establish  that  and  be  famous.\"    In  this \nmanner   Dhritarashtra   spoke   affectionately \nto Yudhishthira.  \nThe   Pandavas   renovated   that   ruined   city, \nbuilt   palaces   and   forts,   and   renamed   it \nIndraprastha.  It  grew  in  wealth  and  beauty \nand became the admiration of the world.  \nThe    Pandavas    ruled    there    happily    for \nthirty-six    years    with    their    mother    and \nDraupadi,  never  straying  from  the  path  of \ndharma. \n",

      "content": "\n IN   the   stories   narrated   in   the   Puranas, \nbirds   and   beasts   speak   like   men,   and \nsometimes   they   give   sound   advice   and \neven    teach    spiritual    wisdom.    But    the \nnatural    qualities    of    those    creatures    are \nadroitly  made  to  peep  through  this  human \nveil.  \nOne   of   the   characteristic   beauties   of   the \nPuranic   literature   is   this   happy   fusion   of \nnature    and    imagination.    In    a    delightful \npassage  in  the  Ramayana,  Hanuman,  who \nis  described  as  very  wise  and  learned,  is \nmade   to   frolic   with   apish   joy,   when   he \nimagined  that  the  beautiful  damsel  he  saw \nat Ravana's inner courtyard was Sita. \nIt  is  usual  to  entertain  children  with  stories  \nin   which   birds   and   beasts   are   made   to \nspeak.  But  the  stories  of  the  Puranas  are \nmeant   for   elderly   people,   and   in   them \nusually    some    background    is    given    in \nexplanation   of   animals   having   the   gift   of \nhuman speech.  \nThe     usual     expedient     employed     is     a \nprevious   birth   when  those  creatures  were \nhuman  beings.  For  instance,  a  deer  was  a  \nrishi  in  a  previous  birth,  or  a  fox  a  king. \nThe  subsequent  degradation  being  due  to \na curse.  \nIn  such  cases  the  deer  will  act  as  a  deer  \nand  yet  speak  as  a  rishi,  and  in  the  fox  the  \nclever    nature   is   shot   through   with   the \ncharacteristics   of   a   wise   and   experienced \nking.    The    stories    are    thereby    made \ninteresting  vehicles  of  the  great  truths  they \nsometimes convey.  \nKhandavaprastha,     that     forest     full     of \nuneven  places  and  thorns  and  prickles  and  \ncumbered  with  the  crumbling  vestiges  of  a  \nlong   dead   city,   was   indeed   a   frightful \nplace  when  it  came  into  the  possession  of \nthe Pandavas.  \nBirds  and  beasts  had  made  it  their  abode,  \nand    it    was    infested    with    thieves    and \nwicked  men.  Krishna  and  Arjuna  resolved  \nto  set  fire  to  the  forest  and  construct  a  new  \ncity in its place. \nA   saranga   bird   was   living   there   with   its \nfour    fledgelings.    The    male    bird    was \npleasantly    roaming    about    in    the    forest \nwith   another   female   bird   neglecting   wife \nand  children.  The  mother  bird  looked  after \nits young ones.  \nAs    the    forest    was    set    on    fire    as \ncommanded   by   Krishna   and   Arjuna   and \nthe  fire  spread  in  all  directions,  doing  its \ndestructive  work,  the  worried  mother  bird \nbegan to lament: \n'The   fire   is   coming   nearer   and   nearer \nburning   everything,   and soon   it   will   be \nhere   and   destroy   us.   All   forest   creatures \nare   in   despair   and   the   air   is   full   of   the \nagonising    crash    of    falling    trees.    Poor \nwingless  babies!  You  will  become  a  prey \nto  the  fire.  What  shall  I  do?  Your  father \nhas   deserted   us,   and   I   am   not   strong \nenough   to   fly   away   carrying   you   with \nme.\" \nTo  the  mother  who  was  wailing  thus,  the \nchildren said:  \n\"Mother,   do   not   torment   yourself   on   our \naccount.  Leave  us  to  our  fate.  If  we  die \nhere,  we  shall  attain  a  good  birth  in  some  \nfuture  life.  If  you  give  up  your  life  for  our  \nsake,   our   family   will   become   extinct.   Fly \nto  a  place  of  safety,  take  another  mate  and  \nbe    happy.    You    will    soon    have    other \nchildren  and  be  able  to  forget  us.  Mother,  \nreflect and do what is best for our race.\" \n\nDespite   this   earnest   entreaty,   the mother \nhad   no   mind   to   leave   her   children.   She \nsaid:  \"I  shall  remain  here  and  perish  in  the  \nflames with you.\" \nThis  is  the  background  of  the  story  of  the  \nbirds.    A    rishi    named    Mandapala    long \nlived    faithful    to    his    vow    of    perfect \nbrahmacharya  but  when  he  sought  entry  to  \nthe   higher   regions,   the   gatekeeper   said: \n\"There   is   no   place   here   for   a   childless \nman\"  and  turned  him  back.  He  was  then \nborn  as  a  saranga  bird  and  lived  with  a \nfemale   companion   named   Jarita.   She   laid \nfour    eggs.    Then    he    left    Jarita    and \nwandered    in the    woods    with    another \nfemale companion, Lapita. \nThe   four   eggs   of   Jarita   hatched   in   time \nand   they   were   the   four   birds   mentioned \nabove.  As  they  were  the  children  of  a  rishi  \nthey    could    cheer    and    encourage    their \nmother in the way they did.  \nThe  mother  bird  told  her  children:  \"There \nis  a  rat-hole  by  the  side  of  this  tree.  I  shall  \nput  you  there.  You  can  get  into  the  hole \nand  escape  the  fire.  I  shall  close  the  mouth  \nof  the  hole  with  earth  and  the  fire  will  not  \ntouch  you.  When  the  fire  dies  down  I  shall  \nlet you out.\" \nThe  children  would  not  agree.  They  said: \n\"The  rat  in  the  hole  will  devour  us.  It  is \nbetter  to  perish  in  the  flames  than  to  die \nignobly by being eaten up by rats.\" \nThe  mother  bird  tried  to  relieve  the  fears \nof  the  children  and  said:  \"I  saw  an  eagle \ndevour  the  rat.  There  is  now  no  danger  for  \nyou inside the hole.\"  \nBut  the  children  said:  \"There  are  sure  to \nbe  other  rats  in  the  hole.  Our  danger  is  not  \nended   by   the   killing   of   one   rat   by   the \neagle.    Kindly    save    your    life    by    flying \nbefore   the   fire   reaches   us   and   this   tree \ncatches  fire.  We  cannot  get  into  the  rat-\nhole.   Why   should   you   sacrifice   your   life \nfor   our   sake?   How   have   we   merited   it, \nwho  have  done  nothing  for  you?

All \nthe   kshatriyas,   including   the   redoubtable \nSisupala  himself,  are  afraid  of  his  prowess  \nand  are  submissive  to  him.  Have  you  not \nheard   of   the   wicked   Kamsa,   the   son   of \nUgrasena?  After  he  had  become  the  son-\nin-law   and   ally   of   Jarasandha   my   people \nand   I   attacked   Jarasandha.   After   three \nyears   of   continuous   fighting   we   had   to \nacknowledge   defeat   and   we   left   Mathura \nand  moved  to  Dwaraka  in  the  west,  and \nbuilt   a   new   city   where   we   are   living   in \npeace   and   plenty.   Even   if   Duryodhana, \nKarna  and  others  do  not  object  to  your \nassuming  the  title  of  emperor,  Jarasandha \nwill  certainly  oppose  it.  And  the  only  way \nto   overcome   his   opposition   is   to   defeat \nand    kill    him.    You    can    then    not    only \nperform  the  Rajasuya  but  also  rescue  and \nwin    the    adherence    of    the    kings    who \nlanguish in his prisons.\" \nAt   these   words   of   Krishna,   Yudhishthira \nsaid:  \"I  agree.  I  am  but  one  of  the  many \nkings    who    rule    their    kingdoms    with \nfairness    and    justice    and    lead    happy \nunambitious   lives.   It   is   mere   vanity   and \nvainglory  to  desire  to  become  an  emperor.  \nWhy  should  not  a  king  rest  satisfied  with \nhis  own  kingdom?  So,  I  shall  give  up  this  \ndesire  to  be  an  emperor.  And  really,  the \ntitle  has  no  temptations  for  me.  It  is  my \nbrothers  who  wish  it.  When  you  yourself \nare  afraid  of  Jarasandha  what  can  we  hope  \nto do?\" \nBhima   did   not   at   all   like   this   spirit   of \ncowardly contentment. \nBhima    said:    \"Ambition    is    the    noblest \nvirtue  of  a  king.  What  is  the  good  of  being  \nstrong   if   one   does   not   know   his   own \nstrength?  I  cannot  reconcile  myself  to  live \na   life   of   idle   ease   and   contentment.   He \nwho    casts    off    indolence    and    properly \nemploys    political    means,    can    conquer \neven  those  stronger  than  himself.  Strength \nreinforced    by    stratagem    will    surely    do \nmuch.      What,      indeed,      cannot      be \naccomplished   by   a   combination   of   my \nphysical   strength,   Krishna's   wisdom   and \nArjuna's     dexterity?     We     can     conquer \nJarasandha's   might,   if   we   three   join   and \nset about it without doubts or fears.\" \nKrishna    interposed:    \"Jarasandha    should \ncertainly  be  slain  and  fully  deserves  it.  He  \nhas    unjustly    cast    eighty-six    princes    in \nprison.   He   has   planned   to   immolate   a \nhundred   kings   and   is   waiting   to   lay   hold \nof   fourteen   more.   If   Bhima   and   Arjuna \nagree,    I    shall    accompany    them    and \ntogether    we    will    slay    that    king    by \n\nstratagem    and    set    free    the    imprisoned \nprinces. I like this suggestion.\"  \nYudhishthira   was   not   pleased   with   this \nadvice.   He   said:   \"This   may   really   mean \nsacrificing   Bhima   and   Arjuna   who   are   to \nme  as  my  two  eyes,  merely  to  gratify  a \nvain  desire  to  be  an  emperor.  I  do  not  like  \nto  send  them  on  this  dangerous  errand.  It  \nseems  to  me  far  better  to  give  up  the  idea  \naltogether.\" \nArjuna  said:  \"What  is  the  use  to  us  of  an \nexistence   without   heroic   deeds,   born   as \nwe  are  of  an  illustrious  line?  A  Kshatriya \nthough    endowed    with    all    other    good \nqualities,   will   not   become   famous   if   he \ndoes   not   exert   himself.  Enthusiasm  is  the \nmother  of  success.  We  can  seize  fortune  if  \nwe   do   our   duties   energetically.   Even   a \npowerful     man     may     fail     if,     through \nlassitude,  he  does  not  employ  the  means \nhe  has.  Failure  is  due,  in  the  vast  majority \nof    cases,    to    ignorance    of    one's    own \nstrength.  We  know  we  are  strong,  and  we  \nare  not  afraid  of  using  our  strength  to  the  \nutmost.  Why  should  Yudhishthira  suppose \nthat  we  are  incapable  of  this?  When  we \nhave  become  old,  it  will  be  time  to  assume  \nthe   ochre   robe,   resort   to   the   forest   and \npass  the  rest  of  our  days  in  penance  and \nausterities.  Now,  we  should  lead  strenuous  \nlives  and  do  heroic  deeds  worthy  of  the \ntraditions of our race.\" \nKrishna  was  delighted  to  hear  these  words  \nand  said:  \"What  else  can  Arjuna,  born  of \nKunti  in  the  Bharata  race,  advise?  Death \ncomes   to   all,   the   hero   as   well   as   the \nsluggard.    But    the    noblest    duty    of    a \nkshatriya  is  to  be  true  to  his  race  and  faith,  \nand    overcoming    his    foes    in    righteous \nbattle, to win glory.\" \nFinally     Yudhishthira     assented     to     the \nunanimous   opinion   that   their   duty   lay   in \nslaying Jarasandha. \nThis  conversation  has  a  curiously  modern \nring  about  it  and  shows  that  powerful  men \nin  ancient  days  used  very  much  the  same \nspecious reasoning as now. \n",

He  did  so  to  keep  \nhis   vow   not   to   show   partiality   to   either. \nSome  time  after  they  had  partaken  of  the  \nfruit, the wives became pregnant. \nThe  delivery  took  place  in  due  course.  But  \ninstead   of   bringing   the   expected   joy,   it \nplunged    them    into    greater    grief    than \nbefore.  For  they  each  gave  birth  to  but  a  \nhalf  of  a  child.  Each  half  was  a  monstrous \nbirth which seemed a revolting lump.  \nThey     were     indeed     two     equal     and \ncomplementary    portions    of    one    baby, \nconsisting  of  one  eye,  one  leg,  half  a  face,  \none  ear  and  so  on.  Seized  with  grief,  they \ncommanded    their    attendants    to    tie    the \n\ngruesome  pieces  in  a  cloth  and  cast  them \naway.  \nThe  attendants  did  as  they  were  instructed  \nand  threw  the  cloth  bundle  on  a  heap  of \nrefuse   in   the   street.   A   cannibal   Rakshasi \nchanced  upon  that  place.  She  was  elated  at  \nseeing  the  two  pieces  of  flesh  and,  as  she  \ngathered  them  up  both  at  once,  accidently \nthe   halves   came   together   the   right   way. \nAnd   they   at   once   adhered   together   and \nchanged  into  a  whole  living  child,  perfect \nin every detail.  \nThe   surprised   Rakshasi   did   not   wish   to \nkill  the  child.  She  took  on  the  guise  of  a \nbeautiful woman   and,   going   to   the   king, \npresented  the  child  to  him  saying:  \"This  is \nyour child.\" \nThe   king   was   immensely   delighted   and \nhanded  it  over  to  his  two  wives.  This  child  \nbecame  known  as  Jarasandha.  He  grew  up  \nin  to  a  man  of  immense  physical  strength. \nBut   his  body  had  one  weakness  namely, \nthat  being  made  up  by  the  fusion  of  two \nseparate  parts,  it  could  be  split  again  into \ntwo, if sufficient force were used. \nThis     interesting     story     embodies     the \nimportant   truth   that   two   sundered   parts \njoined    together    will    still    remain    weak, \nwith    a    tendency    to    split.    When    the \nconquest   and   slaying   of   Jarasandha   had \nbeen    resolved    upon,    Sri    Krishna    said: \n\"Hamsa,   Hidimbaka,   Kamsa,   and   other \nallies  of  Jarasandha  are  no  more.  Now  that  \nhe  is  isolated,  this  is  the  right  time  to  kill \nhim.    It  is  useless  to  fight  with  armies.  He  \nmust  be  provoked  to  a  single  combat  and  \nslain.\"  \nAccording  to  the  code  of  honor  of  those \ndays,    a    kshatriya    had    to    accept    the \nchallenge    to    a    duel    whether    with    or \nwithout weapons.  \nThe   latter   sort   was   a   fight   to   the   death \nwith   weighted   gauntlets   or   a   wrestling   to \nthe  death  in  catch-as-catch-can  style.  This  \nwas    the    kshatriya    tradition    to    which \nKrishna   and   the   Pandavas   had   recourse \nfor slaying Jarasandha. \nThey   disguised   themselves   as   men   who \nhad  taken  religious  vows,  clad  in  robes  of  \nbark-fibre   and   carrying   the   holy   darbha \ngrass  in  their  hands.  Thus  they  entered  the  \nkingdom   of   Magadha   and   arrived   at   the \ncapital of Jarasandha. \nJarasandha  was  disturbed  by  portents  of  ill  \nomen.  To  ward  off  the  threatened  danger,  \nhe  had  propitiatory  rites  performed  by  the  \npriests    and    himself    took    to    fasts    and \npenance.  \nKrishna,   Bhima,   and   Arjuna   entered   the \npalace  unarmed.  Jarasandha  received  them \nwith  respect  as  their  noble  bearing  seemed  \nto    indicate    an    illustrious    origin.    Bhima \nand  Arjuna  made  no  reply  to  his  words  of  \nwelcome   because   they   wished   to   avoid \nhaving to tell lies. \nKrishna  spoke  on  their  behalf:  \"These  two  \nare   observing   a   vow   of   silence   for   the \npresent  as  at  part  of  their  austerities.  They \ncan       speak       only       after       midnight.\" \nJarasandha  entertained  them  in  the  hall  of \nsacrifice and returned to the palace. \nIt  was  the  practice  of  Jarasandha  to  meet  \nnoble  guests  who  had  taken  vows  and  talk  \nto   them   at   their   leisure   and   convenience, \nand so he called at midnight to see them.  \nTheir        conduct        made        Jarasandha \nsuspicious,  and  he  also  observed  that  they \nhad  on  their  hands  the  scars  made  by  the  \nbowstring    and    had    besides    the    proud \nbearing of kshatriyas. \nWhen   Jarasandha   demanded   the   truth   of \nthem  they  said  frankly:  \"We  are  your  foes  \nand  seek  instant  combat.  You  can  choose  \none of us at will to fight with you.\" \nAfter   acquainting   himself   as   to   who   they \nwere,  Jarasandha  said:  \"Krishna,  you  are  a  \ncowherd  and  Arjuna  is  a  mere  boy.  Bhima  \nis  famous  for  his  physical  strength.  So,  I \nwish  to  fight  with  him.\"  Since  Bhima  was  \nunarmed,   Jarasandha   chivalrously   agreed \nto fight him without weapons.  \n\nBhima   and   Jarasandha   were   so   equally \nmatched   in   strength   that   they   fought   with \neach   other   continuously   for   thirteen   days \nwithout   taking   rest   or   refreshments,   while \nKrishna     and     Arjuna     looked     on     in \nalternating hope and anxiety.  \nOn  the  fourteenth  day,  Jarasandha  showed  \nsigns      of      exhaustion,      and      Krishna \nprompted   Bhima   that   the   time   had   come \nto make an end of him.  \nAt   once   Bhima   lifted   him   and   whirling \nhim   round   and   round   a   hundred   times, \ndashed   him   to   the   earth   and   seizing   his \nlegs tore his body asunder into two halves.  \nAnd  Bhima  roared  in  exultation.  The  two \nhalves  at  once  joined  and  Jarasandha,  thus  \nmade   whole,   leapt   up   into   vigorous   life \nand again attacked Bhima.  \nBhima  aghast  at  the  sight,  was  at  a  loss \nwhat  to  do,  when  he  saw  Krishna  pick  up  \na  straw,  tear  it  into  two,  and  cast  the  bits  \nin opposite directions.  \nBhima  took  the  hint,  and  when  once  again \nhe  tore  Jarasandha  asunder  he  threw  the \ntwo  portions  in  opposite  directions,  so  that \nthey   could   not   come   together   and   join. \nThus did Jarasandha meet his end. \nThe   captive   princes   were   released   and \nJarasandha's   son   was   crowned   King   of \nMagadha.     And     Krishna,     Bhima     and \nArjuna returned to Indraprastha. \nWith  Jarasandha  gone,  the  way  was  now \nclear  for  the  Rajasuya  which  the  Pandavas  \nperformed  with  great  pomp  and  splendor. \nYudhishthira      assumed      the      title      of \nemperor. \nThe  celebrations  were  marred  by  only  one  \nincident.  Towards  the  close  of  the  festive \ncelebrations,  at  the  time  of  paying  the  first  \nhonor,   Sisupala   behaved   disrespectfully   in \nthe   assembly   of   princes   and   provoked   a \nfight  with  Krishna  in  which  he  was  slain. \nThis story is told in the next chapter. \n",

We    learn    from    the \nMahabharata  that  walkout  was  resorted  to  \neven in ancient times. \nThe   India   of   those   days   consisted   of   a \nnumber    of    independent    states.    Though \nthere   was   one   dharma   and   one   culture \nthroughout  the  land,  the  autonomy  of  each \nstate was scrupulosly respected.  \nOccasionally,   some   strong   and   ambitious \nmonarch   would   seek   the   assent   of   his \nfellow   kings   to   his   overlordship,   which \nwould     sometimes     be     given     without \nquestion.  \nAfter    receiving    this    assent    he    would \nperform  a  grand  Rajasuya  sacrifice,  which \nall   the   acquiescing   kings   would   attend   in \ntoken      of      acknowledgement      of      his \nsupremacy.  \nIn    accordance    with    this    custom,    the \nPandavas  invited  the  other  kings  after  the \nslaying   of   Jarasandha   and   performed   the \nRajasuya.   \nThe  time  came  for  doing  the  honors  of  the  \noccasion.  The  custom  was  to  render  first \nhonor   to   the   guest   who   was   considered \nmost  worthy  of  taking  precedence  over  all \nothers.  \nThe  question  arose  as  to  who  should  be \nhonored      first.      The      grandsire      was \nemphatically     of     the     opinion     that    Sri \nKrishna,  the  king  of  Dwaraka,  should  be \nhonored       first,       which       was       also \nYudhishthira's own opinion. \nYudhishthira    followed    the    advice    and \nunder  his  instructions  Sahadeva  offered  to \nSri    Krishna    the    honors    enjoined    by \ntradition.  Sisupala,  the  king  of  Chedi,  who  \nhated   Krishna   as   wickedness   alone   can \nhate goodness, could not tolerate it. \nHe   laughed   aloud   in   derision   and   said: \n\"How  ridiculous  and  unjust,  but  I  am  not \nsurprised.   The   man   who   sought   advice \nwas   born   in   illegitimacy.   (This   was   an \ninsulting   allusion   to   the   sons   of   Kunti) \nThe   man   who   gave   advice   was   born   of \none  who  ever  declines  from  high  to  low. \n\n(This    is    in    reference    to    the    fact    that \nBhishma   was   born   of   Ganga,   the   river \nnaturally    flowing    from    higher    to    lower \nlevels.)  And  he  who  did  the  honors  was \nalso   born   illegitimately.   And   what   shall   I \nsay  of  the  man  honored!  He  is  a  fool  by \nbirth  and  a  cowherd  by  breeding.  Dumb \nindeed    must    be    the    members    of    this \nassembly  if  they  have  not  a  word  to  say  to  \nthis! This is no place for worthy men.\"  \nSome  of  the  assembled  princes  applauded  \nSisupala.  Encouraged  by  their  applause  he  \naddressed Yudhishthira:  \n\"When  there  are  so  many  kings  gathered \nhere,  it  is  a  shame  that  you  paid  the  first \nhonor  to  Krishna.  Not  to  render  respect \nwhere   it   is   rightly   due   and   to   render   it \nwhere   it   is   not   merited   are   both   equally \ngrave   offences.   It   is   a   pity   that,   for   all \nyour  imperial  pretensions  you  are  ignorant \nof this.\" \nGetting  more  and  more  angry  as  he  spoke,  \nhe   continued:   \"Ignoring   the   many   kings \nand   heroes   who   are   here   at   your   own \ninvitation    and    in    malicious    despise    of \nthem,   you   have   paid   royal   honors   to   a \ncowherd  boor,  a  mere  nobody.  Vasudeva,  \nthe  father  of  Krishna,  was  but  a  servant  of  \nUgrasena.  He  is  not  even  of  royal  blood. \nIs  this  the  place  and  the  occasion  to  show  \nyour  vulgar  partiality  for  Krishna,  the  son \nof  Devaki?  Is  this  worthy  of  the  children \nof  Pandu?  O  sons  of  Pandu,  you  are  raw,  \nuntaught  youths,  altogether  ignorant  of  the \nway   to   conduct   a   royal   assembly.   This \ndotard   Bhishma   guided   you   foolishly   and \nthus   made   fools   of   you.   Krishna,   why, \nKrishna  is  no  ruler  at  all!  O  Yudhishthira,  \nwhy  did  you  dare  to  do  this  wretch  first \nhonor    in    this    illustrious    assemblage    of \nkings?  He  has  not  even  the  merit  of  age \nand   if   you   admire   grey   hair,   is   not   his \nfather  alive?  You  could  not  have  honored \nhim   as   your   preceptor   surely,   for   your \npreceptor   is   Drona   who   is   here   in   this \nassembly.  Is  it  as  an  expert  in  performing \nsacrifices   that   you   have   honored   him?   It \ncannot  be,  for  Vyasa,  the  great  master,  is  \npresent.  It  would  have  been  better  even  if \nyou  had  paid  the  first  honor  to  Bhishma, \nfor  dotard  as  he  be,  he  has  still  the  merit  \nof   being   the   oldest   man   of   your   house. \nYour   family   teacher,   Kripacharya,   is   also \npresent  in  this  assembly.  How  could  you \nthen  pay  the  first  honor  to  this  cowherd? \nAshwatthama, the   hero   who   is   expert   in \nall  sastras,  is  here.  How  did  you  choose \nKrishna,     forgetting     him?     Among     the \nprinces      assembled      here,      there      is \nDuryodhana.  And  there  is  also  Karna,  the  \ndisciple     of     Parasurama.     Leaving     him \naside,  out  of  childish  partiality,  you  chose \nKrishna  for  the  first  honor  Krishna  who  is  \nneither  royal,  nor  heroic,  nor  learned,  nor \nholy,  nor  even  hoary,  who  is  nothing  but  a  \nlow   cowherd!   Thus   you   have   dishonored \nus   all,   whom   you   have   invited   here.   O \nkings,  it  is  not  out  of  fear  that  we  assented  \nto Yudhishthira's    assuming    the    title    of \nemperor.  We  personally  do  not  much  care  \nwhether   he   is   friend   or   foe.   But,   having \nheard  much  prate  of  his  righteousness,  we  \nwanted   to   see   him   uphold   the   flag   of \ndharma.  He  has  now  wantonly  dishonored  \nus,  after  all  that  talk  of  virtue  and  dharma.  \nWhat   virtue   or   dharma   was   there   in   his \ngiving    priority    of    honor    to    this    villain \nKrishna    who    killed    Jarasandha    in    an \nunjust   manner?      You   should   henceforth \ncall   Yudhishthira   an   unrighteous   person. \nO  Krishna,  what  impudence  on  your  part \nto   accept   the   undeserved   honor   which \nthese   misguided   Pandavas   did   you!   Did \nyou   forget   yourself?   Or   did   you   forget \ndecent  tradition?  Or  was  it  just  a  case  of  a  \ndog  snatching  at  a  remnant  of  food  which \nnobody  cared  to  claim  or  guard?  Do  you \nnot   really   see  that  this  farce  is  a  ghastly \nmockery   and   disgrace   to   yourself?   It   is \nlike    the    mockery    of    showing    beautiful \nthings  to  a  blind  man  or  offering  a  maiden \nin   marriage   to   a   eunuch.   Likewise,   these \n\nkingly  honors  are  really  an  affront  to  you.  \nIt    is    now    evident    that    the    would-be \nemperor        Yudhishthira,        the        senile \nBhishma,   and   this   fellow   Krishna   are   all \nmade of the same stuff.\"  \nAfter   Sisupala   had   spoken   these   harsh \nwords,  he  rose  from  his  seat  and  walked \nout   calling   upon   the   other   kings   to   join \nhim  in  resenting  the  insult.  Many  of  them \nfollowed him.  \nYudhishthira   ran   after   them   and   tried   to \nappease  them  with  sweet  words  of  peace \nbut  in  vain,  for  they  were  too  angry  to  be  \nappeased.  \nSisupala's    aggressive    vanity    waxed    to \nfighting  pitch,  and  there  ensued  a  terrible \nfight   between   Krishna   and   Sisupala,   in \nwhich the latter was slain by his discus.  \nThe   Rajasuya   was   duly   celebrated   and \nYudhishthira recognised emperor. \n",

Be \nvigilant   and   rule   the   kingdom,   farewell.\" \nAnd   Vyasa   blessed   Yudhishthira.   Vyasa's \nwords   filled   Yudhishthira   with   grief   and \nwith    a    great    repugnance    for    worldly \nambition and life itself.  \nHe  informed  his  brothers  of  the  prediction \nof     unavoidable     racial     disaster.     Life \nseemed  to  him  a  bitter  and  weary  business  \nand    his    destiny    particularly    cruel    and \nunbearable. \nArjuna  said:  \"You  are  a  king  and  it  is  not  \nright  for  you  to  be  agitated.  Let  us  meet \ndestiny   with   an   undaunted   front   and   do \nour duty.\" \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"Brothers,   may   God \nprotect   us   and   give   us   wisdom.   For   my \npart,   I   take   this   vow   never   to   speak \nharshly  to  my  brothers  or  to  my  kinsmen \nfor  the  next  thirteen  years.  I  shall  avoid  all \npretext  for  conflict.  I  shall  never  give  way \nto   anger,   which   is   the   root   cause   of \nenmity.   It   shall   be   my   duty   to   give   no \noccasion  for  anger  or  pretext  for  hostility. \nThus  shall  we  profit  by  Bhagavan  Vyasa's  \nwarning.\"   His   brothers   expressed   cordial \nassent. \nThe    first    event    of    the    series    which \nculminated   in   the   devastating   slaughter   on \nthe  blood-sodden  field  of  Kurukshetra  and  \nthe  event  which  was  the  evil  root  of  all, \nwas    the    gambling    match    into    which \nYudhishthira    was    inveigled    by    Sakuni, \nwho was Duryodhana's evil genius. \nWhy  did  the  wise  and  good  Yudhishthira \nsuffer  himself  to  be  persuaded  to  this  step  \nwhich   he   must   have   known   to   hold   evil \npossibilities? \n\nThe  main  cause  was  his  fixed  resolve  to \nbe  on  amicable  terms  with  his  cousins  by \nnot  opposing  their  wishes.  And  a  friendly \ninvitation   to   dice   could   not   be   summarily \nturned  down,  since  the  etiquette  of  those \ndays  made  it  a  point  of  honor  to  accept  a  \ngame of equal hazard. \nOut  of  his  very  anxiety  to  foster  goodwill,  \nhe   laid   open   the   field   for   the   poisonous \nseed   of   hatred   and   death.   Here   is   an \nillustration   of   the   futility   of   human   plans, \nhowever    well    meant    or    wise,    without \ndivine    aid.    Our    best    wisdom    is    vain \nagainst   fate,   and   if   destiny   is   kind,   our \nvery follies turn to our advantage. \nWhile   Dharmaputra   was   care-worn   with \nsolicitude  to  avoid  a  quarrel  at  all  costs, \nDuryodhana  was  burning  with  jealousy  at \nthe    thought    of    the    prosperity    of    the \nPandavas   that   he   had   witnessed   in   their \ncapital during the Rajasuya sacrifice.  \nDuryodhana    saw    unprecedented    wealth, \nattractive   and   sight   eluding   crystal   doors \nand   many   pieces   of   exquisite   artistry   in \nthe      court-hall      of      Yudhishthira,      all \nsuggestive of great prosperity. \nHe  also  saw  how  glad  the  kings  of  many \ncountries  were  to  become  the  allies  of  the  \nPandavas.  This  gave  him  unbearable  grief. \nHe   was   so   absorbed   in   sorrow   at   the \nprosperity  of  the  Pandavas  that  he  did  not  \nat  first  hear Sakuni  who  was  by  his  side,  \nspeaking to him. \nSakuni    asked:    \"Why    are    you    sighing? \nWhy are you tormented with sorrow?\" \nDuryodhana         replied:         \"Yudhishthira, \nsurrounded  by  his  brothers,  is  like  Indra, \nthe  king  of  gods.  Before  the  very  eyes  of \nthe   assembled   kings   Sisupala   was   slain \nand  not  one  of  them  had  the  courage  to \ncome   forward   to   avenge   him.   Like   the \nvaisyas   who   live   by   trade,   they   bartered \ntheir   honor   and   jewels   and   riches   for \nYudhishthira's  goodwill.  How  can  I  avoid \ngiving   way   to   grief   after   seeing   all   this? \nWhat is the good of living?\" \nSakuni      said:      \"O      Duryodhana,      the \nPandavas  are  your  brothers.  It  is  not  right  \non    your    part    to    be    jealous    of    their \nprosperity.   They   are   but   enjoying   their \nlegitimate     inheritance.     By     their     good \nfortune      they      have      prospered      and \nflourished    without    doing    any    injury    to \nothers.  Why  should  you  be  jealous?  How \ncan   their   strength   and   happiness   diminish \nyour     greatness?     Your     brothers     and \nrelations   stand   by   you   and   obey   you. \nDrona,   Ashwatthama   and   Karna   are   on \nyour    side.    Why    do    you    grieve    when \nBhishma,    Kripa,    Jayadratha,    Somadatta \nand  myself  are  your  supporters?  You  can \nconquer   even   the   whole   world.   Do   not \ngive way to grief.\"  \nAt    these    words,    Duryodhana    said:    \"O \nSakuni,  it  is  true  that  I  have  so  many  to \nsupport  me.  Why  should  we  not  wage  war  \nand      drive      the      Pandavas      out      of \nIndraprastha?\" \nBut   Sakuni   said:   \"No.   That   will   not   be \neasy,    but    I    know    a    way    to    drive \nYudhishthira  out  of  Indraprastha  without  a \nfight or the shedding of blood.\"  \nThe  eyes  of  Duryodhana  lighted  up,  but  it  \nseemed   too   good   to   be  true.  He  asked \nincredulously:    \"Uncle,    is    it    possible    to \novercome        the        Pandavas        without \nsacrificing any life? What is your plan?\" \nSakuni   replied:   \"Yudhishthira   is   fond   of \nthe   game   of   dice   and   being   unskillful   is \naltogether   ignorant   of   its   tricks   and   the \nopportunity  it  offers  to  cleverer  people.  If \nwe  invite  him  to  a  game,  he  would  accept,  \nfollowing  the  tradition  of  the  kshatriyas.  I \nknow  the  tricks  of  the  game  and  I  shall \nplay   on   your   behalf.   Yudhishthira   will   be \nhelpless  as  a  child  against  me.  I  shall  win \nhis   kingdom   and   wealth   for   you   without \nshedding a drop of blood.\" \n",

What  \nis  here  that  you  already  do  not  enjoy?  The  \nwhole  world  is  at  your  feet.  When  you  are  \nsurrounded   by all  kinds  of  pleasures  like \nthe   very   gods,   why   should   you   pine   in \nsorrow?    You    have    learnt    the    Vedas, \narchery,  and  other  sciences  from  the  best \nof   masters.   As   my   first   born,   you   have \ninherited   the   throne.

He \nreferred  to  the  prosperity  he  had  seen  in \nthe   capital   of   the   Pandavas   that   to   him \nwas   bitterer   than   loss   of   his   all   would \nhave been. \nHe  burst  out:  \"Contentment  with  one's  lot \nis   not   characteristic   of   a   kshatriya.   Fear \nand   pity   lower   the   dignity   of   kings.   My \nwealth  and  pleasures  do  not  give  me  any \nsatisfaction    since    I    have    witnessed    the \ngreater    prosperity    of    Yudhishthira.    O \nking,  the  Pandavas  have  grown,  while  we \nhave shrunk.\" \nDhritarashtra    said:    \"Beloved    child,    you \nare  the  eldest  son  of  my  royal  spouse  and  \nme  and  heir  to  the  glory  and  greatness  of \nour   renowned   race.   Do   not   cherish   any \nhatred  towards  the  Pandavas.  Sorrow  and  \ndeath  will  be  the  sole  result  of  hatred  of \nkith   and   kin,   especially   when   they   are \nblameless.  Tell  me,  why  do  you  hate  the \nguileless      Yudhishthira?      Is      not      his \nprosperity   ours   too?   Our   friends   are   his \nfriends.  He  has  not  the  least  jealousy  or \nhatred  towards  us.  You  are  equal  to  him  in  \nheroism  and  ancestry.  Why  should  you  be  \njealous  of  your  brother?  No.  You  should \nnot   be   jealous.\"   Thus   said   the   old   king \nwho,  though  overfond  of  his  son,  did  not \noccasionally  hesitate  to  say  what  he  felt  to  \nbe just.  \nDuryodhana  did  not  at  all  like  the  advice \nof  his  father,  and  his  reply  was  not  very \nrespectful.  \nHe   replied:   \"The   man   without   common \nsense,  but  immersed  in  learning,  is  like  a \nwooden   ladle   immersed   in   savoury   food \nwhich   it   neither   tastes   nor   benefits   from. \nYou  have  much  learning  of  statecraft  but \nhave   no   state   wisdom   at   all,   as   your \nadvice  to  me  clearly  shows.  The  way  of \nthe     world     is     one     thing     and     the \nadministration   of   a   state   is   quite   another. \nThus    has    Brihaspati    said:    'Forbearance \nand    contentment,    though    the    duties    of \nordinary   men,   are   not   virtues   in   kings.' \nThe  kshatriya's  duty  is  a  constant  seeking \nof victory.\"  \nDuryodhana   spoke   thus   quoting   maxims \nof     politics     and     citing     examples     and \nmaking    the    worse    appear    the    better \nreason.  \nThen   Sakuni   intervened   and   set   forth   in \ndetail     his     infallible     plan     of     inviting \nYudhishthira   to   play   the   game   of   dice, \ndefeating  him  utterly  and  divesting  him  of \nhis all without recourse to arms.  \nThe    wicked    Sakuni    wound    up    with \nsaying:   \"It   is   enough   if   you   merely   send \nfor  the  son  of  Kunti  to  play  the  game  of \ndice. Leave the rest to me.\" \nDuryodhana   added:   \"Sakuni   will   win   for \nme  the  riches  of  the  Pandavas  without a \nfight,   if   you   would   only   agree   to   invite \nYudhishthira.\" \nDhritarashtra   said:   \"Your   suggestion   does \nnot  seem  proper.  Let  us  ask  Vidura  about  \nit. He will advise us rightly.\" \nBut    Duryodhana    would    not    hear    of \nconsulting   Vidura.   He   said   to   his   father: \n\"Vidura will  only  give  us  the  platitudes  of \n\nordinary   morality,   which   will   not   help   us \nto  our  object.  The  policy  of  kings  must  be  \nvery   different   from   the   goody   maxims   of \ntextbooks,  and  is  sterner  stuff  of  which  the  \ntest  is  success.  Moreover,  Vidura  does  not  \nlike   me   and   is   partial   to   the   Pandavas. \nYou know this as well as I do.\"  \nDhritarashtra    said:    \"The    Pandavas    are \nstrong.  I  do  not  think  it  wise  to  antagonize  \nthem.  The  game  of  dice  will  only  lead  to \nenmity.   The   passions   resulting   from   the \ngame   will   know   no   bounds. We   should \nnot do it.\" \nBut   Duryodhana   was   importunate:   \"Wise \nstatesmanship   lies   in   casting   off   all   fear \nand    protecting    oneself    by    one's    own \nefforts.   Should   we   not   force   the   issue \nwhile  yet  we  are  more  powerful  than  they \nare?   That   will   be   real   foresight.   A   lost \nopportunity  may  never  come  again,  and  it \nis  not  as  though  we  invented  the  game  of \ndice   to   injure   the   Pandavas.   It   is   an \nancient    pastime    which    kshatriyas    have \nalways   indulged   in,   and   if   it   will   now \nserve    us    to    win    our    cause    without \nbloodshed, where is the harm?\" \nDhritarashtra   replied:   \"Dear   son,   I   have \ngrown  old.  Do  as  you  like.  But  the  line \nthat  you  are  taking  does  not  appeal  to  me.  \nI  am  sure  you  will  repent  later.  This  is  the  \nwork of destiny.\"  \nIn  the  end,  out-argued  and  through  sheer \nfatigue  and  hopelessness  of  dissuading  his \nson,   Dhritarashtra   assented,   and   ordered \nthe   servants   to   prepare   a   hall   of   games. \nYet    he    could    not    forbear    consulting \nVidura in secret about the matter. \nVidura      said:      \"O      king,      this      will \nundoubtedly   bring   about   the   ruin   of   our \nrace by raising up unquenchable hate.\" \nDhritarashtra,   who   could   not   oppose   the \ndemand  of  his  son,  said:  \"If  fortune  favors  \nus  I  have  no  fear  regarding  this  game.  If \non   the   contrary,   fortune   goes   against   us, \nhow  could  we  help  it?  For,  destiny  is  all-\npowerful.   Go   and   invite   Yudhishthira   on \nmy  behalf  to  come  and  play  dice.\"  Thus \ncommanded,   Vidura   went   to   Yudhishthira \nwith an invitation. \nThe     weak-witted     Dhritarashtra,     over-\npersuaded,  yielded  to  the  desire  of  his  son  \nthrough  his  attachment  to  him  in  spite  of \nthe  fact  that  he  knew  this  was  the  way  that  \ndestiny was working itself out. \n",

I  have  come  to  invite  \nyou   on   behalf   of   King   Dhritarashtra   to \ncome   and   see   the   newly   erected   hall   of \ngames.   A   beautiful   hall   has   been   erected \nthere  even  like  yours.  The  king  would  like  \nyou   to   come   with   your   brothers,   see \neverything,    have    a    game    of    dice    and \nreturn to your capital.\" \nYudhishthira   seemed   to   ask   counsel   of \nVidura:   \"Wagering   games   create   quarrels \namong  kshatriyas.  A  wise  man  will  avoid \nthem   if   he   can. We  are  ever  abiding  by \nyour   advice.   What   would   you   have   us \ndo?\" \nVidura   replied:   \"Everyone   is   aware   that \nthe   playing   of   dice   is   the   root   of   many \nevils.  I  did  my  best  to  oppose  this  idea. \nStill  the  king  has  commanded  me  to  invite  \nyou  and  I  have  come.  You  may  do  as  you  \nlike.\"  \nDespite   this   warning,   Yudhishthira   went \nto    Hastinapura    with    his    brothers    and \nretinue.   It   may   be   asked   why   the   wise \nYudhishthira responded to the invitation.  \nThree   reasons   may   be   given.   Men   rush \nconsciously  on  their  ruin  impelled  by  lust, \ngambling    and    drink.    Yudhishthira    was \nfond   of   gambling.   The   kshatriya   tradition \nmade  it  a  matter  of  etiquette  and  honor  not  \nto refuse an invitation to a game of dice.  \n\nThere  is  a  third  reason  too.  True  to  the \nvow  he  took  at  the  time  Vyasa  had  warned  \nhim    of    the    quarrels    that    would    arise \nleading     to     destruction     of     the     race. \nYudhishthira  would  not  give  any  occasion \nfor   displeasure   or   complaint   by   refusing \nthe invitation of Dhritarashtra.  \nThese   causes   conspired   with   his   natural \ninclination    to    make    Yudhishthira   accept \nthe  invitation  and  go  to  Hastinapura.  The \nPandavas  and  their  retinue  stopped  in  the \nmagnificent palace reserved for them.  \nYudhishthira  rested  on  the  day  of  arrival, \nand  after  the  daily  routine  of  duties,  went \nto the hall of games the next morning.  \nAfter      the      exchange      of      customary \ngreetings,        Sakuni        announced        to \nYudhishthira  that  the  cloth  for  playing  the \ngame  had  been  spread  and  invited  him  to  \nit. \nYudhishthira     at     first     said:     \"O     king, \ngambling  is  bad.  It  is  not  through  heroism \nor  merit  that  one  succeeds  in  a  game  of \nchance.    Asita,    Devala    and    other    wise \nrishis   who   were   well-versed   in   worldly \naffairs  have  declared  that  gambling  should \nbe  avoided  since  it  offers  scope  for  deceit.  \nThey  have  also  said  that  conquest  in  battle  \nis  the  proper  path  for  the  kshatriyas.  You  \nare not unaware of it.\"  \nBut    a    part    of    himself,    weakened    by \naddiction  to  gambling,  was  at  war  with  his  \njudgment    and    in    his    heart    of    hearts \nYudhishthira desired to play.  \nIn  his  discussion  with  Sakuni,  we  see  this \ninner   conflict.      The   keen-witted   Sakuni \nspotted   this   weakness   at   once   and   said: \n\"What  is  wrong  with  the  game?  What,  in \nfact,  is  a  battle?  What  is  even  a  discussion  \nbetween  Vedic  scholars?  The  learned  man \nwins  victory  over  the  ignorant.  The  better \nman  wins  in  every  case.  It  is  just  a  test of \nstrength   or   skill,   that   is   all,   and   there   is \nnothing  wrong  in  it.  As  for  the  result,  in \nevery   field   of   activity,   the   expert   defeats \nthe  beginner,  and  that  is  what  happens  in  a  \ngame  of  dice  also.  But  if  you  are  afraid, \nyou  need  not  play.  But  do  not  come  out  \nwith    this    worn    excuse    of    right    and \nwrong.\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"Well,    who    is    to \nplay with me?\" \nDuryodhana       said:       \"Mine       is       the \nresponsibility  for  finding  the  stakes  in  the \nform   of   wealth   and   gems   to   play   the \ngame.  My  uncle  Sakuni  will  actually  cast \nthe dice in my stead.\" \nYudhishthira   had   thought   himself   secure \nof    defeating    Duryodhana    in    play    but \nSakuni  was  a  different  matter,  for  Sakuni \nwas  a  recognised  expert.  So  he  hesitated \nand  said:  \"It  is  not,  I  think,  customary  for  \none man to play on behalf of another.\"  \nSakuni  retorted  tauntingly:  \"I  see  that  you \nare forging another excuse.\" \nYudhishthira   flushed   and,   casting   caution \nto the winds, replied: \"Well, I shall play.\" \nThe  hall  was  fully  crowded.  Drona,  Kripa,  \nBhishma,   Vidura,   and   Dhritarashtra   were \nseated   there.   They   knew   that   the   game \nwould    end    viciously    and    sat    unhappily \nwitnessing what they could not prevent.  \nThe  assembled  princes  watched  the  game \nwith  great  interest  and  enthusiasm.  At  first  \nthey  wagered  jewels  and  later  gold,  silver \nand  then  chariots  and  horses.  Yudhishthira  \nlost continually.  \nWhen    he    lost    all    these,    Yudhishthira \nstaked  his  servants  and  lost  them  also.  He  \npledged  his  elephants  and  armies  and  lost \nthem   too.   The   dice   thrown   by   Sakuni \nseemed at every time to obey his will. \nCows,   sheep, cities,   villages   and   citizens \nand   all   other   possessions   were   lost   by \nYudhishthira.        Still,        drugged        with \nmisfortune, he would not stop.  \nHe  lost  the  ornaments  of  his  brothers  and  \nhimself   as   well   as   the   very   clothes   they \nwore.  Still  bad  luck  dogged  him,  or  rather \nthe  trickery  of  Sakuni  was  too  much  for \nhim. \n\nSakuni  asked:  \"Is  there  anything  else  that \nyou can offer as wager?\" \nYudhishthira   said:   \"Here   is   the   beautiful \nsky-complexioned   Nakula.   He   is   one   of \nmy riches. I place him as a wager.\" \nSakuni  replied:  \"Is  it  so?  We  shall  be  glad  \nto   win   your   beloved   prince.\"   With   these \nwords  Sakuni  cast  the  dice  and  the  result  \nwas what he had foretold. \nThe assembly trembled. \nYudhishthira   said:   \"Here   is   my   brother \nSahadeva.   He   is   famous   for   his   infinite \nknowledge  in  all  the  arts.  It  is  wrong  to \nbet him, still I do so. Let us play.\"  \nSakuni    cast    the    dice    with    the    words: \n\"Here,     I     have     played     and     I     have \nwon.\"Yudhishthira lost Sahadeva too. \nThe    wicked    Sakuni    was    afraid    that \nYudhishthira    might    stop    there.    So    be \nlashed    Yudhishthira    with    these    words: \n\"To   you,   Bhima   and   Arjuna,   being   your \nfull  brothers,  are  no  doubt  dearer  than  the  \nsons  of  Madri.  You  will  not  offer  them,  I  \nknow.\" \nYudhishthira,     now     thoroughly     reckless \nand   stung   to   the   quick   by   the   sneering \nimputation   that   he   held   his   step-brothers \ncheap,   replied:   \"Fool,   do   you   seek   to \ndivide   us?   How   can   you,   living   an   evil \nlife,    understand    the    righteous    life    we \nlead?\" \nHe  continued:  \"I  offer  as  wager  the  ever-\nvictorious       Arjuna       who       successfully \nvoyages   across   oceans   of   battle.   Let   us \nplay.\"  \nSakuni  answered:  \"I  cast  the  dice\"  and  he  \nplayed. Yudhishthira lost Arjuna also. \nThe     stubborn     madness     of     unbroken \nmisfortune     carried     Yudhishthira     further \nand  deeper.  With  tears  in  his  eyes,  he  said:  \n\"O  king,  Bhima,  my  brother,  is  our  leader  \nin  battle.  He  strikes  terror  into  the  heart  of  \ndemons   and   is   equal   to   Indra;   he   can \nnever  suffer  the  least  dishonor  and  he  is \npeerless   throughout   the   world   in   physical \nstrength.   I   offer   him   as   a   bet\"   and   he \nplayed again and lost Bhima too. \nThe   wicked   Sakuni   asked:   \"Is   there   any \nthing else you can offer?\" \nDharmaputra     replied:     \"Yes.     Here     is \nmyself. If you win, I shall be your slave.\" \n\"Look.   I   win.\"   Thus   saying,   Sakuni   cast \nthe  dice  and  won.  After  that  Sakuni  stood  \nup  in  the  assembly  and  shouted  the  names  \nof   each   of   the   five  Pandavas  and  loudly \nproclaimed   that   they   had   all   become   his \nlawful slaves.  \nThe    assembly    looked    on    in    stunned \nsilence.          Sakuni          alone          turned \ntoYudhishthira    and    said:    \"There    is    one \njewel   still   in   your   possession   by   staking \nwhich  you  can  yet  free  yourself.  Can  you \nnot   continue   the   game   cffering   your   wife \nDraupadi as wager?\" \nYudhishthira   despairingly   said:   \"I   pledge \nher,\" and he trembled unwittingly. \nThere  was  audible  distress  and  agitation  in \nthat  part  of  the  assembly  where  the  elders  \nsat.  Soon  great  shouts  of  'Fie!  Fie!'  arose  \nfrom  all  sides.  The  more  emotional  wept. \nOthers  perspired,  and  felt  the  end  of  the \nworld was come.  \nDuryodhana,    his    brothers    and    Karna \nshouted    with    exultation.    In    that    group \nYuyutsu  alone  bent  his  head  in  shame  and  \nsorrow   and   heaved   a   deep   sigh.   Sakuni \ncast  the  dice  and  shouted  again:  \"I  have \nwon.\" \nAt  once  Duryodhana  turned  to  Vidura  and  \nsaid:  \"Go  and  fetch  Draupadi,  the  beloved  \nwife   of   the   Pandavas.   She   must   hence \nforward  sweep  and  clean  our  house.  Let \nher come without delay.\" \nVidura  exclaimed:  \"Are  you  mad  that  you \nrush    to    certain    destruction?    You    are \nhanging    by    a    slender    thread    over    a \nbottomless    abyss!    Drunk    with    success, \nyou do not see it, but it will engulf you!\"  \nHaving     thus     reprimanded     Duryodhana, \nVidura   turned   to   the   assembly   and said: \n\"Yudhishthira    had    no    right    to    stake \n\nPanchali  as  by  then  he  had  himself  already \nlost  his  freedom  and  lost  all  rights.  I  see \nthat  the  ruin  of  the  Kauravas  is  imminent, \nand  that,  regardless  of  the  advice  of  their \nfriends    and    well-wishers,    the    sons    of \nDhritarashtra are on the path to hell.\" \nDuryodhana  was  angry  at  these  words  of \nVidura       and       told       Prathikami,       his \ncharioteer:  \"Vidura  is  jealous  of  us  and  he  \nis   afraid   of   the   Pandavas.   But   you   are \ndifferent.   Go   forth   and   bring   Draupadi \nimmediately.\" \n",

Now   you \nbelong   to   Duryodhana.   I   have   come   by \nDuryodhana's   command to   take   you   to \nserve   in   his   household   as   maid   servant, \nwhich will hereafter be your office.\" \nDraupadi,  the  spouse  of  the  emperor  who  \nhad         performed         Rajasuya,         was \ndumbfounded,    at    this    strange    message. \nShe  asked:  \"Prathikami,  what  do  you  say?  \nWhich  prince  would  pledge  his  wife?  Had  \nhe nothing else to pawn?\" \nPrathikami   answered:   \"It   is   because   he \nhad  already  lost  all  other  possessions  and \nhad    nothing    else    left    that    he    played \noffering you as a stake.\"  \nThen  he  told  her  the  whole  story  of  how \nYudhishthira   had   lost   all   his   wealth   and \nhad   finally   betted   her,   after   having   first \nforfeited his brothers and himself.   \nThough  the  news  was  such  as  to  break  the  \nheart  and  kill  the  soul,  still,  Draupadi  soon \nregained    her    fortitude    and,    with    anger \nblazing  from  her  eyes,  said:  \"O  charioteer,  \nreturn.  Ask  of  him  who  played  the  game \nwhether   in   it   he   first   lost   himself,   or   his \nwife.    Ask    this    question    in    the    open \nassembly.   Bring   me   his   answer   and   then \nyou  can  take  me.\"  Prathikami  went  to  the  \nassembly    and,    turning    to    Yudhishthira, \nasked    of    him    the    question    put    by \nDraupadi. \nYudhishthira remained speechless.  \nThen   Duryodhana   bade   Prathikami   bring \nPanchali    herself    there    to    question    her \nhusband.     Prathikami     went     again     to \nDraupadi   and   humbly   said:   \"Princess,   the \nmean-minded   Duryodhana   desires   you   to \ngo  to  the  assembly  and  ask  your  question \nyourself.\" \nDraupadi   answered:   \"No.   Return   to   the \nassembly     and     put     the     question     and \ndemand an answer.\"  \nPrathikami did so. \nEnraged,     Duryodhana     turned     to     his \nbrother  Duhsasana  and  said:  \"This  man  is \na   fool   and   is   afraid   of   Bhima.   Go   and \nfetch  Draupadi  even  if  you  have  to  drag \nher here.\" \nThus   commanded,   the   wicked   Duhsasana \nat  once  sped  with  joy  on  his  errand.  He \nproceeded   to   the   place   where   Draupadi \nwas,  shouting:  \"Come,  why  do  you  delay?  \nYou  are  now  ours.  Be  not  shy,  beautiful \nlady.  Make  yourself  agreeable  to  us,  now \nthat  you  have  been  won  by  us.  Come  to \nthe   assembly\"   and   in   his   impatience,   he \nbade   as   though   to   take   her   thither   by \nforce.  \nPanchali     rose     trembling,     heart-stricken \nwith  sorrow  and  started  to  fly  for  refuge  to  \nthe    inner    apartments    of    Dhritarashtra's \nqueen.  Duhsasana  darted  after  her,  caught \nher   by   the   hair   and   dragged   her   to   the \nassembly.  \nIt  is  with  a  shudder  of  repugnance  that  we  \nrelate    how    the    sons    of    Dhritarashtra \nstooped to commit this vilest of deeds. \nAs   soon   as   she   came   to   the   assembly, \nDraupadi     controlled     her     anguish     and \nappealed to the elders gathered there: \n\"How   could   you   consent   to   my   being \nstaked    by    the    king    who    was    himself \ntrapped   into   the   game   and   cheated   by \nwicked   persons,   expert   in   the  art?  Since \n\nhe  was  no  longer  a  free  man,  how  could \nhe stake anything at all?\"  \nThen,  stretching  out  her  arms  and  raising \nher   flowing   eyes   in   agonised   supplication \nshe cried in a voice broken with sobs: \n\"If    you    have    loved    and    revered    the \nmothers  who  bore  you  and  gave  you  suck,  \nif  the  honor  of  wife  or  sister  or  daughter \nhas   been   dear   to   you,   if   you   believe   in \nGod  and  dharma,  forsake  me  not  in  this \nhorror more cruel than death\"' \nAt  this  heart-broken  cry,  as  of  a  poor  fawn  \nstricken   to   death,   the   elders   hung   their \nheads   in   grief   and   shame.   Bhima   could \nhold  himself  no  longer.  His  swelling  heart \nfound  relief  in  a  roar  of  wrath  that  shook  \nthe      very      walls,      and      turning      to \nYudhishthira he said bitterly:  \n\"Even    abandoned    professional    gamblers \nwould  not  stake  the  harlots  who  live  with \nthem,  and  you,  worse  than  they,  have  left  \nthe  daughter  of  Drupada  to  the  mercy  of \nthese  ruffians.  I  cannot  bear  this  injustice. \nYou   are   the   cause   of   this   great   crime. \nBrother   Sahadeva,   bring   fire.   I   am   going \nto  set  fire  to  those  hands  of  his  which  cast  \nthe dice.\"  \nArjuna   however   remonstrated   gently   with \nBhima:   \"You   have   never   before   spoken \nthus.  The  plot  devised  by  our  enemies  is \nentangling    us    also    in    its    meshes    and \ninciting   us   to   wicked   action.   We   should \nnot     succumb     and     play     their     game. \nBeware.\"  \nWith      a      superhuman      effort,      Bhima \ncontrolled his anger. \nVikarna,   the   son   of   Dhritarashtra,   could \nnot    bear    the    sight    of    the    agony    of \nPanchali.    He    rose    up    and    said:    \"O \nKshatriya   heroes,   why   are   you   silent?   I \nam  a  mere  youth,  I  know,  but  your  silence  \ncompels  me  to  speak.  Listen.  Yudhishthira  \nwas   enticed   to   this   game   by   a   deeply \nplotted  invitation  and  he  pledged  this  lady \nwhen  he  had  no  right  to  do  so,  because \nshe  does  not  belong  to  Yudhishthira  alone.  \nFor  that  reason  alone  the  wager  is  illegal. \nBesides,  Yudhishthira  had  already  lost  his \nfreedom,  and  being  no  longer  a  free  man,  \nhow  could  he  have  a  right  to  offer  her  as  a  \nstake?  And  there  is  this  further  objection. \nIt   was   Sakuni   who   suggested   her   as   a \npledge,   which   is   against   the   rules   of   the \ngame,    under    which   neither   player   may \ndemand  a  specific  bet.  If  we  consider  all \nthese  points,  we  must  admit  that  Panchali \nhas  not  been  legally  won  by  us.  This  is  my  \nopinion.\" \nWhen    the    young    Vikarna    spoke    thus \ncourageously,   the   wisdom   given   by   God \nto  the  members  of  the  assembly  suddenly \nillumined   their   minds.   There   were   great \nshouts      of      applause.      They      shouted: \n\"Dharma   has   been   saved.   Dharma   has \nbeen saved.\" \nAt that moment Karna rose up and said: \n\"O    Vikarna,    forgetting    that    there    are \nelders  in  this  assembly,  you  lay  down  the \nlaw   though   you   are   but   a   stripling.   By \nyour    ignorance    and    rashness    you    are \ninjuring   the   very   family   which   gave   you \nbirth,   just   as   the   flame   generated   by   the \narani  destroys  its  source,  the  stick.  It  is  an  \nill  bird  that  fouls  its  own  nest.  At  the  very \nbeginning,   when   Yudhishthira   was   a   free \nman,   he   forfeited   all   he   possessed   and \nthat,  of  course,  included  Draupadi.  Hence,  \nDraupadi  had  already  come  into  Sakuni's \npossession.   There   is   nothing   more   to   be \nsaid  in  the  matter.  Even  the  clothes  they \nhave   on   are   now   Sakuni's   property.   O \nDuhsasana,    seize    the    garments    of    the \nPandavas  and  the  robes  of  Draupadi  and \nhand them over to Sakuni.\" \nAs  soon  as  they  heard  the  cruel  words  of \nKarna,  the  Pandavas,  feeling  that  they  had  \nto  stand  the  test  of  dharma  to  the  bitter \nend,   flung   off   their   upper   garments   to \nshow  that  they  were  ready  to  follow  the \npath of honor and right at any cost. \nSeeing   this,   Duhsasana   went   to   Draupadi \nand   made   ready   to   seize   her   clothes   by \n\nforce.  All  earthly  aid  had  failed,  and  in  the  \nanguish      of      utter      helplessness,      she \nimplored divine mercy and succour:  \n\"O  Lord  of  the  World,\"  she  wailed,  \"God  \nwhom  I  adore  and  trust,  abandon  me  not  \nin  this  dire  plight.  You  are  my  sole  refuge.  \nProtect me.\" And she fainted away.  \nThen,  as  the  wicked  Duhsasana  started  his  \nshameful    work    of    pulling    at    Panchali's \nrobes    and    good    men    shuddered    and \naverted  their  eyes,  even  then,  in  the  mercy \nof God a miracle occurred.   \nIn   vain   Duhsasana   toiled   to   strip   off   her \ngarments,  for  as  he  pulled  off  each,  ever \nfresh   garments   were   seen   to   clothe   her \nbody,     and     soon     a     great     heap     of \nresplendent   clothes   was   piled   up   before \nthe   assembly   till   Duhsasana   desisted   and \nsat down in sheer fatigue.  \nThe  assembly  trembled  at  this  marvel  and \ngood  men  praised  God  and  wept.  Bhima \nwith    quivering    lips,    loudly    uttered    this \nterrible  oath:  \"May  I  never  go  to  the  blest  \nabode  of  my  ancestors  if  I  do  not  rend  the  \nbreast  and  drink  the  heart's  blood  of  this \nsinful     Duhsasana,     this     shame     of     the \nBharata race.\" \nSuddenly,  the  howling  of  jackals  could  be  \nheard.    Donkeys    and    carnivorous    birds \nbegan  to  send  forth  weird  dissonant  cries \nfrom   all   sides,   portending   calamities   to \ncome.  \nDhritarashtra     who     realised     that     this \nincident    would    be    the    cause    of    the \ndestruction  of  his  race,  for  once  acted  with  \nwisdom  and  courage.  He  called  Draupadi \nto   his   side   and   attempted   to   soothe   her \nwith words of gentleness and affection.  \nThen  he  turned  to  Yudhishthira  and  said: \n\"You  are  so  blameless  that  you  can  have \nno   enemies.   Forgive   in   your   magnanimity \nthe  evil  done  by  Duryodhana  and  dismiss \nall   memory of   it   from   your   mind.   Take \nback    your    kingdom    and    riches    and \neverything      else      and      be      free      and \nprosperous.   Return   to   Indraprastha.\"   And \nthe    Pandavas    left    that    accursed    hall, \nbewildered    and    stunned,    and    seeing    a \nmiracle     in     this     sudden     release     from \ncalamity. But it was too good to endure. \nAfter   Yudhishthira   and   his   brothers   had \ndeparted,   there   was   a   long   and   angry \ndiscussion  in  the  palace  of  the  Kauravas. \nIncited  by  Duhsasana,  Sakuni  and  others, \nDuryodhana    upbraided    his    father    with \nhaving   frustrated   their   well-laid   plans   on \nthe very threshold of success.  \nHe   quoted   Brihaspati's   aphorism   that   no \ndevice   could   be   considered   wrong   which \nhad    as    its    object    the    destruction    of \nformidable enemies.  \nHe  spoke  in  detail  on  the  prowess  of  the  \nPandavas    and    expressed    his    conviction \nthat   the   only   hope   of   overcoming   the \nPandavas     lay     in     guile     and     taking \nadvantage   of   their   pride   and   sense   of \nhonor. \nNo   self-respecting  kshatriya  could  decline \nan     invitation     to     a     game     of     dice. \nDuryodhana    secured    his    doting    father's \nreluctant  and  ominous  approval  to  a  plan \nto   entice   Yudhishthira   once   again   to   a \ngame of dice. \nA   messenger   was   accordingly   dispatched \nafter    Yudhisthira    who    had    taken    his \ndeparture   for   Indraprastha.   He   came   up \nwith   Yudhishthira   before   the   latter   had \nreached  his  destination  and  invited  him  on \nbehalf of king Dhritarashtra to come back.  \nOn    hearing    this    invitation,    Yudhishthira \nsaid:   \"Good   and   evil   come   from   destiny \nand  cannot  be  avoided.  If  we  must  play \nagain  we  must,  that  is  all.  A  challenge  to \ndice   cannot   in   honor   be   refused.   I   must \naccept    it.\"    Truly,    as    Sri    Vyasa    says: \n\"There   never   was   and   never   can   be   an \nantelope  of  gold!  Yet,  Rama  went  in  vain \npursuit  of  what  seemed  one.  Surely,  when \ncalamities   are   imminent,   the   judgment   is \nfirst destroyed.\" \nDharmaputra   returned   to   Hastinapura and \nset  again  for  a  game  with  Sakuni,  though \n\neveryone  in  the  assembly  tried  to  dissuade  \nhim.  \nHe  seemed  a  mere  pawn  moved  by  Kali  to  \nrelieve the burden of the world.   \nThe  stake  played  for  was  that  the  defeated  \nparty   should   go   with   his   brothers   into \nexile to   the   forest   and   remain   there   for \ntwelve  years  and  spend  the  thirteenth  year  \nincognito.   If   they   were   recognised   in   the \nthirteenth   year,   they   should   go   again   into \nexile for twelve years.  \nNeedless   to   say,   Yudhishthira   met   with \ndefeat    on    this    occasion    also,   and   the \nPandavas  took  the  vows  of  those  who  are  \nto go to the forest.  \nAll   the   members   of   the   assembly   bent \ndown their heads in shame. \n",

On   all \nsides  cries  arose  of:  \"Fie  and  Alas!  Does \nnot God see this from His heaven?\" \nThe   blind   Dhritarashtra   sent   for   Vidura \nand  asked  him  to  describe  the  departure  of  \nthe   Pandavas   into   exile.   Vidura   replied: \n\"Yudhishthira,  the  son  of  Kunti,  went  with \nhis  face  covered  with  a  cloth.  Bhima  went  \nbehind  with  his  eyes  lowered  on  his  arms.  \nArjuna   proceeded   scattering   sand   on   his \npath.   Nakula   and   Sahadeva   besmeared \ntheir     bodies     with     dust     and     closely \nfollowed           Yudhishthira.           Draupadi \naccompanied            Dharmaputra,            her \ndishevelled  hair  covering  her  face  and  her \neyes   streaming   with   tears.   Dhaumya,   the \npriest,   went   along   with   them   singing   the \nSama   hymns,   addressed   to   Yama,   the \nLord of Death.\" \nWhen  he  heard  these  words,  Dhritarashtra  \nwas    filled    with    ever-greater    fear    and \nanxiety  than  before.  He  asked:  \"What  do \nthe citizens say?\" \nVidura   answered:   \"O   great   king,   I   shall \ntell   you   in   their   own   words   what   the \ncitizens  of  all  castes  and  creeds  say:  'Our \nleaders  have  left  us.  Fie  on  the  elders  of \nthe   Kuru   race   who   have   suffered   such \nthings      to      happen!      The      covetous \nDhritarashtra   and   his   sons   have   driven \naway   the   sons   of   Pandu   to   the   forest.' \nWhile    the    citizens    blame    us    thus,    the \nheavens      are      vexed      with      cloudless \nlightning,  and  the  distressed  earth  quakes, \nand there are other evil portents.\" \nWhile    Dhritarashtra    and    Vidura    were \nconversing  thus,  the  sage  Narada  suddenly \nappeared   before   them.   Narada   declared: \n\"Fourteen     years     from     this     day     the \nKauravas  will  become  extinct  as  the  result  \nof   the   crime   committed   by   Duryodhana\" \nand vanished from sight.  \nDuryodhana    and    his    companions    were \nfilled   with   fear   and   approached   Drona \nwith   a   prayer   never   to   abandon   them, \nwhatever happened.  \nDrona   answered   gravely:   \"I   believe   with \nthe  wise  that  the  Pandavas  are  of  divine \nbirth   and   unconquerable.   Yet   my   duty   is \nto  fight  for  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra  who \nrely  on  me  and  whose  salt  I  eat.  I  shall \nstrive  for  them,  heart  and  soul.  But  destiny  \nis   all-powerful.   The   Pandavas   will   surely \nreturn   from   exile,   burning   with   anger.   I \nshould     know     what     anger is,    for    I \ndethroned    and    dishonored    Drupada    on \naccount     of     my     anger     towards     him. \nImplacably   revengeful,   he   has   performed \na   sacrifice   so   that   he   might   be   blessed \nwith  a  son  who  would  kill  me.  It  is  said \nDhrishtadyumna   is   that   son.   As   destiny \nwould  have  it,  he  is  the  brother-in-law  and  \nfast  friend  of  the  Pandavas.  And  things  are  \nmoving    as    foreordained.    Your    actions \ntend  in  the  same  direction  and  your  days \n\nare  numbered.  Lose  no  time  in  doing  good  \nwhile   you   may;   perform   great   sacrifice, \nenjoy   sinless   pleasures,   give   alms   to   the \nneedy.   Nemesis   will   overtake   you   in   the \nfourteenth  year.  Duryodhana,  make  peace \nwithYudhishthira    this    is    my    counsel    to \nyou.  But,  of  course,  you  will  do  what  you \nlike.\" \nDuryodhana   was   not   at   all   pleased   with \nthese words of Drona. \nSanjaya    asked    Dhritarashtra:    \"O    king, \nwhy are you worried?\" \nThe  blind  king  replied:  \"How  can  I  know \npeace after having injured the Pandavas?\" \nSanjaya  said:  \"What  you  say  is  quite  true.  \nThe    victim    of    adverse    fate    will    first \nbecome  perverted,  utterly  losing  his  sense \nof     right     and     wrong.     Time,     the     all \ndestroyer,  does  not  take  a  club  and  break  \nthe  head  of  a  man  but  by  destroying  his \njudgment,   makes   him   act   madly   to   his \nown  ruin.  Your  sons  have  grossly  insulted \nPanchali   and   put   themselves   on   the   path \nof destruction.\"  \nDhritarashtra   said:   \"I   did   not   follow   the \nwise   path   of   dharma   and   statesmanship \nbut   suffered   myself   to   be   misled   by   my \nfoolish  son  and,  as  you  say,  we  are  fast \nhastening towards the abyss.\" \nVidura     used     to     advise     Dhritarashtra \nearnestly.  He  would  often  tell  him:  \"Your \nson     has     committed     a     great     wrong. \nDharmaputra  has  been  cheated.  Was  it  not  \nyour  duty  to  turn  your  children  to  the  path  \nof   virtue   and   pull   them   away   from   vice? \nYou    should    order    even    now    that    the \nPandavas  get  back  the  kingdom  granted  to  \nthem   by   you.   Recall   Yudhishthira   from \nthe  forest  and  make  peace  with  him.  You \nshould  even  restrain  Duryodhana  by  force \nif he will not listen to reason.\"  \nAt   first   Dhritarashtra   would   listen   in   sad \nsilence   when   Vidura   spoke   thus,   for   he \nknew   Vidura   to   be   a   wiser   man   than \nhimself     who     wished     him     well.     But \ngradually    his    patience    wore    thin    with \nrepeated homilies. \nOne  day,  Dhritarashtra  could  stand  it  no \nlonger.  \"O  Vidura,\"  he  burst  out,  \"you  are  \nalways   speaking   for   the   Pandavas   and \nagainst   my   sons.   You   do   not   seek   our \ngood.  Duryodhana  was  born  of  my  loins. \nHow  can  I  give  him  up?  What  is  the  use  \nof   advising   such   an   unnatural   course?   I \nhave  lost  my  faith  in  you  and  do  not  need  \nyou  anymore.  You  are  free  to  go  to  the \nPandavas   if   you   like.\"   Then,   turning   his \nback   on   Vidura,   he   retired   to   the   inner \napartments.  \nVidura       sorrowfully       felt       that       the \ndestruction  of  the  Kuru  race  was  certain \nand,    taking    Dhritarashtra    at    his    word, \ndrove  in  a  chariot  with  fleet  horses  to  the  \nforest where the Pandavas lived.  \nDhritarashtra     was     filled     with     anxious \nremorse.   He   reflected   thin   himself:   \"What \nhave   I   done?   I   have   only   strengthened \nDuryodhana,     while     driving     the     wise \nVidura to the Pandavas.\" \nBut  later  he  called  for  Sanjaya  and  asked  \nhim  to  bear  a  repentant  message  to  Vidura  \nimploring   him   to   forgive   the thoughtless \nwords of an unhappy father and to return.  \nSanjaya   hurried   to   the   hermitage   where \nthe    Pandavas    were    staying    and    found \nthem  clad  in  deer-skin  and  surrounded  by \nsages.  \nHe  also  saw  Vidura  there  and  conveyed \nDhritarashtra's   message   adding      that   the \nblind  king  would  die  broken-hearted  if  he  \ndid not return.  \nThe  soft-hearted  Vidura,  who  was  dharma  \nincarnate,  was  greatly  moved  and  returned  \nto Hastinapura. \nDhritarashtra    embraced    Vidura    and    the \ndifference    between    them    was    washed \naway in tears of mutual affection. \nOne  day,  the  sage  Maitreya  came  to  the \ncourt  of  Dhritarashtra  and  was  welcomed \nwith great respect. \n\nDhritarashtra     craved     his     blessing     and \nasked     him:     \"Revered     sir,     you     have \ncertainly    met    my    beloved    children,    the \nPandavas,  in  Kurujangala.  Are  they well? \nWill   mutual   affection   abide   in   our   family \nwithout any diminution?\"  \nMaitreya      said:      \"I      accidentally      met \nYudhishthira   in   the   Kamyaka   forest.   The \nsages  of  the  place  had  come  to  see  him.  I  \nlearnt   of   the   events   that   took   place   in \nHastinapura,   and   I   marvelled   that   such \nthings   should   have   been   permitted   while \nBhishma and yourself were alive.\"  \nLater,  Maitreya  saw  Duryodhana  who  was  \nalso  in  the  court    and  advised  him,  for  his  \nown  good,  not  to  injure  but  to  make  peace  \nwith   the   Pandavas   who   were   not   only \nmighty   themselves   but   related   to   Krishna \nand Drupada. \nThe    obstinate    and    foolish    Duryodhana \nmerely    laughed,    slapping    his    thighs    in \nderision   and,   tearing   the   ground   with   his \nfeet    and    without    granting    an    answer, \nturned away.  \nMaitreya    grew    angry    and    looking    at \nDuryodhana   said:   \"Are   you   so   arrogant \nand  do  you  slap  your  thighs  in  derision  of \none   who   wishes   you   well?   Your   thighs \nwill  be  broken  by  a  Bhima's  mace  and  you  \nwill    die    on    the    battlefield.\"    At    this \nDhritarashtra  jumped  up,  fell  at  the  feet  of \nthe sage and begged forgiveness. \nMaitreya  said:  \"My  curse  will  not  work  if \nyour  son  makes  peace  with  the  Pandavas.  \nOtherwise  it  will  have  effect,\"  and  strode \nindignantly out of the assembly. \n",

The    sieges \ndescribed   in   the   Mahabharata   seem   very \nmuch   like   those   in   wars of   the   present \nday.  \nDwaraka     was     a     strongly     garrisoned \nfortress    built    on    an    island    and    well \nprovided   with   means   of   defence.   Ample \nbarracks  had  been  provided  and  there  was  \nan  abundant  supply  of  food  and  weapons \nand   the   garrison   included   many   illustrious \nwarriors.  \nUgrasena   imposed   a   stringent   ban   upon \ndrinking    and    amusements    generally    for \nthe   period   of   the   siege.   All   the   bridges \nwere   demolished   and   ships   were   forbidd \nenentry into ports in the realm. \nIron   spikes   were   planted   in   the   moats \naround  the  fortress  and  the  city  walls  kept  \nin good repair.   \nAll   entrances   to   the   city   were   guarded \nwith     barbed     wire     and     permits     and \npasswords   strictly   controlled   ingress   and \negress.     Thus     no     arrangements     were \nneglected  that  could  further  strengthen  the \ncity    which    nature    had    already    made \nimpregnable.  \nThe   pay   of   the   soldiers   was   increased. \nVolunteers   for   service   were   rigidly   tested \nbefore being accepted as soldiers. \nThe   siege   was   so   rigorously   pushed   that \nthe    garrison    suffered    great    privations. \nKrishna,  when  he  returned,  was  struck  to  \nthe  heart  at  the  sufferings  of  his  beloved \ncity   and   he   compelled   Salva   immediately \nto    raise    the    siege,    by    attacking    and \ndefeating him.  \nIt  was  only  afterwards  that  Krishna  learnt \nfor    the    first    time    of    the    events    at \nHastinapura,   the   game   of   dice   and   the \nexile  of  the  Pandavas.  At  once  be  set  out  \nfor   the   forest   where   the   Pandavas   were \nliving. \nAlong   with   Krishna   went   many,   including \nmen    of    the    Bhoja    and    Vrishni    tribes, \nDhrishtaketu,    the    king    of    the    Chedi \ncountry,   and   the   Kekayas   who   were   all \ndevoted to the Pandavas.  \n\nThey       were       filled       with       righteous \nindignation       when       they       heard       of \nDuryodhana's   perfidy   and   cried   out   that \nsurely  the  earth  would  drink  the  blood  of \nsuch wicked people.  \nDraupadi  approached  Sri  Krishna  and,  in  a  \nvoice   drowned   in   tears   and   broken  with \nsobs,   told   the   story   of   her   wrongs.   She \nsaid:  \"I  was  dragged  to  the  assembly  when  \nI  had  but  a  single  garment  on  my  body. \nThe    sons    of    Dhritarashtra    insulted    me \nmost   outrageously   and   gloated   over   my \nagony.

Even      Bhishma      and \nDhritarashtra  forgot  my  birth  and  breeding \nand      my      relationship      to      them.      O \nJanardhana,   even   my   husbands   did   not \nprotect  me  from  the  jeers  and  the  ribald \ninsults    of    those    foul    ruffians.    Bhima's \nbodily  strength  and  Arjuna's  Gandiva  bow \nwere    alike    of    no    avail.    Under    such \nsupreme     provocation     even     weaklings \nwould  have  found  strength  and  courage  to  \nstrike  the  vile  insulter  dead.  The  Pandavas  \nare  renowned  heroes  and  yet  Duryodhana \nlives!     I,     the     daughter-in-law     of     the \nemperor  Pandu,  was  dragged  by  my  hair. \nI,  the  wife  of  five  heroes,  was  dishonored.  \nO   Madhusudana,   even   you   had   deserted \nme.\"   She   stood   trembling,   utterly   unable \nto continue, for the grief convulsed her. \nKrishna    was    deeply    moved    and    he \nconsoled   the   weeping  Draupadi.  He  said: \n\"Those     who     tormented     you     will     be \nstricken   to   death   in   the   bloody   quagmire \nof    a    lost    battle.    Wipe    your    eyes.    I \nsolemnly     promise     that     your     grievous \nwrongs   shall   be   amply   avenged.   I   shall \nhelp  the  Pandavas  in  every  way.  You  will \nbecome   an   empress.   The   heavens   may \nfall,  the  Himalayas  may  split  in  twain,  the \nearth   may   crumble   or   the   boundless   sea \nmay   dry   up,   but,   I   tell   you   verily,   my \nwords    shall    stand.    I    swear    this,\"    and \nKrishna    took    a    solemn    vow    before \nDraupadi.   \nThis  vow,  it  will  be  seen,  was  in  perfect \naccord   with   the   purpose   of   the   Lord's \navatars, as declared in scriptures:  \n\"For      protecting      the      righteous,      for \ndestroying    the    wicked    and    for    firmly \nupholding  the  law,  I  am  born  on  earth  age  \nafter age.\" \nDhrishtadyumna   also   consoled   his   sister \nand  told  her  how  nemesis  would  overtake  \nthe Kauravas.  \nHe  said:  \"I  will  kill  Drona,  Sikhandin  will \ncause   Bhishma's   fall.   Bhima   will   take   the \nlives   of   the   wicked   Duryodhana   and   his \nbrothers.    Arjuna    will    slay    Karna,    the \ncharioteer's son.\"  \nSri    Krishna    said:    \"When    this    calamity \nbefell  you,  I  was  in  Dwaraka.  Had  I  been \nin  Hastinapur,  I  would  never  have  allowed  \nthis  fraudulent  game  of  dice  to  take  place.  \nUninvited,   I   would   have   gone   there   and \nstirred   up   Drona,   Kripa   and   the   other \nelders  to  a  sense  of  duty. I  would,  at  all \ncosts,  have  prevented  this  destructive  play \nof  dice.  When  Sakuni  was  cheating  you,  I  \nwas     fighting     King     Salva     who     had \nbesieged  my  city.  It  was  only  after  I  had \ndefeated  him  that  I  came  to  know  of  the \ngame   of   dice   and   the   subsequent   sordid \nstory.  It  grieves  me  that  I  am  not  able  to  \nremove  your  sorrows  immediately  but  you \nknow,  some  water  must  be  lost  before  a \nbroken dam is restored.\"  \nThen  Krishna  took  leave  and  returned  to \nDwaraka    with    Subhadra,    the    wife    of \nArjuna, and their child, Abhimanyu.  \nDhrishtadyumna   went   back   to   Panchala \ntaking with him the sons of Draupadi. \n",

Yudhishthira     would     firmly \nreply    that    they    should    abide    by    the \npromise they     had     made     and     that \nforbearance was the highest virtue of all.  \nBhima    was    burning    with    impatience    to \nattack   and   kill   Duryodhana   immediately \nand  win  back  the  kingdom.  He  thought  it \nunworthy  of  warriors  to  continue  to  dwell \ntamely in the forest.  \nBhima   said   to   Yudhishthira:   \"You   speak \nlike  those  who  repeat  Vedic  mantras  and \nare  satisfied  with  the  sound  of  the  words \nthough   ignorant   of   their   meaning.      Your \nintellect   has   become   confused.   You   are \nborn  as  a  kshatriya  and  yet  you  do  not \nthink    or    behave    like    one.    You    have \nbecome  a  brahmana  by  temperament.  You \nknow,  the  scriptures  enjoin  on  a  kshatriya  \nsternness   and   enterprise.   We   should   not \nlet  the  wicked  sons  of  Dhritarashtra  have \ntheir  way.  Vain  is  the  birth  of  a  kshatriya  \nwho    does    not    conquer    his    deceitful \nenemies.  This  is  my  opinion,  and  to  me,  if \nwe   go   to   hell   by   killing   a   deceitful   foe, \nsuch    hell    is    heaven.    Your    forbearance \nburns   us   worse   than   fire.   It   scorches \nArjuna  and  myself  day  and  night,  making \nus  sleepless.  Those  miscreants  have  seized  \nour  kingdom  by  fraud  and  are  enjoying  it,  \nwhile  you  lie  torpid  like  a  gorged  python. \nYou   say   that   we   should   abide   by   our \npromise.   How   can   the   world-renowned \nArjuna   live   incognito?   Can   the   Himalayas \nbe  hidden  under  a  handful  of  grass?  How \ncan   the   lion-hearted   Arjuna,   Nakula   and \nSahadeva   live   in   hiding?   Can   the   famous \nDraupadi    walk    about    unrecognized    by \nothers?   Even   if   we   do   these   impossible \nthings,   the   son   of   Dhritarashtra   will   find \nout  through  his  spies.  Hence,  this  promise \nof  ours  is  impossible  of  performance  and \nhas  been  put  on  us  merely  to  thrust  us  out  \nagain    for    another    thirteen    years.

You   should   resolve   to   kill   our \nenemies   immediately.   There   is   no   higher \nduty for a kshatriya.\" \nBhima   was   never   tired   of   pressing   his \nview.   Draupadi   also   would   refer   to   the \ndishonor  she  had  suffered  at  the  hands  of \nDuryodhana,   Karna   and   Duhsasana   and \nwould      quote      authorities      from      the \nscriptures    that    would    give    Yudhishthira \nanxiety to think.  \nHe      would      sometimes      answer      with \ncommon   maxims   of   politics   and   refer   to \nthe   relative   strength   of   the   parties.      He \nwould     say:     \"Our     enemy     has     such \nadherents      as      Bhurisravas,      Bhishma, \nDrona,        Karna        and        Aswatthama. \nDuryodhana  and  his  brothers  are  expert  in \nwarfare.   Many   feudatory   princes,   as   well \nas   mighty   monarchs,   are   now   on   their \nside.  Bhishma  and  Drona,  indeed,  have  no  \nrespect   for   Duryodhana's   character,   but \nwill  not  give  him  up  and  are  prepared  to  \nsacrifice   their   lives   on   his   side   in   the \nbattlefield.   Karna   is   a   brave   and   skilful \nfighter,   well   versed   in   the   use   of   all   the \nweapons.      The      course      of      war      is \nunpredictable    and    success    is    uncertain. \nThere   is   no   use   in   being   hasty.\"   Thus \nYudhishthira    managed    with    difficulty    to \nrestrain    the    impatience    of    the    younger \nPandavas.  \nLater,  as  advised  by  Vyasa,  Arjuna  went \nto  the  Himalayas  to  practise  austerities  for  \nthe  purpose  of  getting  new  weapons  from \nthe    devas.    Arjuna    took    leave    of    his \nbrothers  and went  to  Panchali  to  bid  her \nfarewell.  \nShe    said:    \"O    Dhananjaya,    may    you \nprosper   in   your   mission.   May   God   give \nyou   all   that   Kuntidevi   hoped   and   wished \nfor  when  you  were  born.  The  happiness, \n\nlife,  honor  and  prosperity  of  us  all  depend  \non    you.    Return    after    acquiring    new \nweapons.\"   Thus   Panchali   sent   him   forth \nwith auspicious words.   \nIt  is  noteworthy  that  though  the  voice  was  \nDraupadi   the   wife's,   yet   the   benediction \nwas   Kunti   the   mother's   for   the   words \nwere:   \"May   God   give   all   that   Kuntidevi \nwished   and   hoped   for   when   you   were \nborn.\"  \nArjuna   passed   through   dense   forests   and \nreached   the   mountain   of   Indrakila,   where \nhe   met   an   old   brahmana.   The   ascetic \nsmiled and spoke affectionately to Arjuna:  \n\"Child,   you   are   clad   in   armor   and   carry \nweapons.  Who  are  you?  Weapons  are  of \nno  use  here.  What  do  you  seek  in  this  garb  \nof  a  kshatriya  in  this  abode  of  ascetics  and  \nsaints    who    have    conquered    anger    and \npassion?\"   That   was   Indra,   the   king   of \ngods,  who  came  to  have  the  pleasure  of \nmeeting his son.  \nArjuna   bowed   to   his   father   and   said:   \"I \nseek  arms.  Bless  me  with  weapons.\"  Indra  \nreplied:  \"O  Dhananjaya,  what  is  the  use  of \nweapons?  Ask  for  pleasures  or  seek  to  go  \nto higher worlds for enjoyment.\" \nArjuna  answered:  \"O  king  of  gods,  I  do \nnot   seek   pleasures   of   higher   worlds.   I \nhave  come  here  after  leaving  Panchali  and  \nmy   brothers   in   the   forest.   I   seek   but \nweapons.\"  \nThe    thousand-eyed    said:    \"If    you    be \nblessed   by   the   vision   of   god   Siva,   the \nthree-eyed  god,  and  obtain  his  grace,  you \nwill   receive   divine   weapons.   Do   penance \nunto Siva.\" \nThus    saying    Indra    disappeared.    Then, \nArjuna   went   to   the   Himalayas   and   did \npenance to obtain the grace of Siva.   \nSiva   under   the   guise   of   a   hunter   and \naccompanied      by      his      divine      spouse \nUmadevi,   entered   the   forest   in   pursuit   of \ngame.  \nThe   chase   grew   fast   and   furious, and \npresently    a    wild    boar    started    charging \nArjuna,  who  shot  an  arrow  into  it  with  his  \nGandiva  bow  at  the  same  moment  that  the  \nhunter  Siva  transfixed  it  with  a  shaft  from \nhis Pinaka bow.  \nArjuna   shouted   in   loud   voice:   \"Who   are \nyou?   Why   are   you   ranging   in   this  forest \nwith   your   wife?   How   dare   you   shoot   at \nthe game I had aimed at?\"  \nThe  hunter  replied  as  though  in  contempt: \n\"This   forest,   full   of   game,   belongs   to   us, \nwho   live   in   it.   You   do   not   look   tough \nenough  to  be  a  forester.  Your  limbs  and \nbearing  bespeak  a soft  luxurious  life.  It  is  \nrather  for  me  to  ask  what  you  are  doing \nhere.\"  He  also  added  that  it  was  his  shaft  \nthat  had  killed  the  boar,  and  that  if  Arjuna  \nthought   differently   be   was   welcome   to \nfight about it. \nNothing   could   please   Arjuna   better.   He \njumped     up    and    showered    snake-like \narrows   at   Siva.   To   his   amazement,   they \nseemed   to   have   no   effect   on   the   hunter \nand   fell   back   hurtless   like   storm-driven \nrain from a mountain peak.  \nWhen  he  had  no  more  arrows,  he  started  \nto  strike  Siva  with  his  bow.  But  the  hunter  \nseemed  not  to  heed  it  and  wrenched  with \nease   the   bow   out   of   Arjuna's   hand   and \nburst into laughter.  \nArjuna,    who    had    been    disarmed    with \nhumiliating   ease   by   one   who   seemed   an \nordinary   hunter   of   the   forest,   was   struck \nwith    amazement,    almost    amounting    to \ndoubt.  But  undaunted,  he  drew  his  sword \nand continued the combat.  \nThe   sword   was   split   into   pieces   on   the \nhunter's    adamantine    frame.    There    was \nnow  nothing  to  do  but  to  grapple  with  the  \nformidable   unknown.   But   here   again   he \nwas outmatched.  \nThe  hunter  caught  him  in  an  iron  clasp  so  \nclose    that    Arjuna    was    quite    helpless.  \nWorsted      and      overmastered,      Arjuna \nhumbly   sought   divine   aid   and   meditated \non  Siva.  As  he  did  so,  a  light  broke  on  his  \n\ntroubled  mind,  and  at  once  he  knew  who  \nthe hunter really was.  \nHe  fell  at  the  feet  of  the  Lord  and,  in  a \nbroken  voice  of  repentance  and  adoration \nhe  prayed  for  forgiveness.  \"I  forgive  you,\" \nsaid  Siva  smilingly  and  gave  him  back  his \nGandiva    bow,    as    well    as    the    other \nweapons,  of  which  he  had  been  deprived.  \nHe     also     bestowed     on     Arjuna     the \nmarvellous Pasupata weapon.  \nArjuna's   body,   battered   in   the   unequal \ncombat,  was  made  whole  and  perfect  by \nthe  divine  touch  of  the  three-eyed  god  and  \nbecame  a  hundred  fold  stronger  and  more  \nbrilliant than before.  \n\"Go  to  heaven  and  render  dutiful  respect \nto    your    father    Indra,\"    said    Siva    and \nvanished from view like the setting sun.  \nArjuna    was    overcome    with    joy    and \nexclaimed:   \"Have   I   really   seen   the   Lord \nface  to  face  and  have  I  been  blessed  with \nhis divine touch? What more do I need?\"  \nAt  that  moment,  Matali,  the  charioteer  of \nIndra,   came   there   with   his   chariot   and \ntook Arjuna to the kingdom of the gods. \n",

Deeply  distressed  by  what  he  \nsaw, Balarama said to Krishna: \n\"O  Krishna,  it  would  seem  that  virtue  and  \nwickedness  bear  contrary  fruit  in  this  life. \nFor  see,  the  wicked  Duryodhana  is  ruling \nhis   kingdom   clad   in   silk   and   gold,   while \nthe    virtuous    Yudhishthira    lives    in    the \nforest   wearing   the   bark   of   trees.   Seeing \nsuch  unmerited  prosperity  and  undeserved \nprivation,  men  have  lost  their  faith  in  God.  \nThe  praise  of  virtue  in  the  sastras  seems \nmere   mummery   when   we   see   the   actual \nresults   of   good   and   evil   in   this   world. \nHow   will   Dhritarashtra   justify   his   conduct \nand  defend  himself  when  he  is  face  to  face  \nwith     the     god     of     death?     Even     the \nmountains  and  the  earth  weep  at  the  sight  \nof  the  blameless  Pandavas  dwelling  in  the \nforests   with   the   blessed   Draupadi,   born \nfrom the sacrificial fire.\"  \nSatyaki,   who   was   seated   near,   said:   \"O \nBalarama,   this   is   no   time   for   lamenting. \nShould   we   wait   till   Yudhishthira   asks   us \nto  do  our  duty  for  the  Pandavas?  While \nyou  and  Krishna  and  all  other  relations  are  \nliving,   why   should   the   Pandavas   waste \ntheir  precious  years  in  the  forest? Let  us \ncollect  our  forces  and  attack  Duryodhana. \nWith   the   army   of   the   Vrishnis,   we   are \nsurely    strong    enough    to    destroy    the \nKauravas.  Why,  where  is  the  need  to  foil \nKarna's   vaunted   archery   and   cut   off   his \nhead.   Let   us   kill   Duryodhana   and   his \nadherents  in  the  battlefield  and  hand  over \nthe     kingdom     to     Abhimanyu     if     the \nPandavas  wish  to  keep  their  word  and  stay  \nin  the  forest.  This  is  good  for  them  and \nbefits us as men of valor.\" \nVasudeva,   who   was   listening   carefully   to \nthis  speech,  said:  \"What  you  say  is  true. \nBut    the    Pandavas    would    not    like    to \nreceive  from  the  hands  of  others  what  they  \nhave    not    won    by    their    own    efforts. \nDraupadi  for  one,  born  of  a  heroic  race  as  \nshe  is,  would  not  hear  of  it.  Yudhishthira \nwill     never     give     up     the     path     of \nrighteousness   for   love   or   fear.  When  the \nstipulated  period  of  exile  is  over  the  kings  \nof    Panchala,    Kekaya    and    Chedi    and \nourselves  will  unite  our  forces  to  help  the \nPandavas to conquer their enemies.\" \nYudhishthira  was  delighted  at  these  words \nof  Krishna.  \"Sri  Krishna  knows  my  mind,\" \nsaid   he.   \"Truth   is   greater   than   power   or \nprosperity   and   has   to   be   guarded   at   all \ncosts   and   not   the   kingdom.   When   he \nwants  us  to  fight,  he  shall  find  us  ready. \nThe  heroes  of  the  Vrishni  race  may  now \nreturn   with   the   certainty   that   we   shall \nmeet   again   when   the   time   is   ripe.\"   With \nthese  words  Yudhishthira  gave  them  leave \nto return.  \nArjuna   was   still   away   in   the   Himalayas \nand     Bhima's     anxiety     and     impatience \n\nbecame   well   nigh   insupportable.   He   said \nto Yudhishthira:  \n\"You    know    that    our    life    depends    on \nArjuna.  He  has  been  away  very  long,  and  \nwe   have   had   no   tidings   of   him.   If   he \nshould  be  lost  to  us,  then  neither  the  king \nof   Panchala,   nor   Satyaki   nor   even   Sri \nKrishna  can  save  us,  and  I  for  one  cannot  \nsurvive  that  loss.  All  this  we  owe  to  that \nmad    game    of    dice,    our    sorrows    and \nsufferings,  as  well  as  the  growing  strength \nof  our  foes.  To  be  dwelling  in  the  forest  is  \nnot  the  duty  enjoined  on  a  kshatriya.  We \nshould    immediately    recall    Arjuna    and \nwage  war  with  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra, \nwith   the   help   of   Sri   Krishna.   I   shall   be \nsatisfied   only   when   the   wicked   Sakuni, \nKarna   and   Duryodhana   are   slain.   After \nthis   clear   duty   is   done,   you   may,   if   you \nlike,  return  to  the  forest  and  live  a  life  of \nasceticism.   It   is   not   a   sin   to   kill   by \nstratagem  an  enemy  who  has  resorted  to \nstratagem.   I   have  heard  that  the  Atharva \nVeda      has      incantations,      which      can \ncompress  time  and  reduce  its  span.  If  we  \ncould,   by   such   means,   squeeze   thirteen \nyears   into   thirteen   days,   we   would   be \nperfectly   justified   in   doing   so,   and   you \nwill   permit   me   on   the   fourteenth   day to \nkill Duryodhana.\"  \nHearing       these       words       of       Bhima, \nDharmaputra   affectionately   embraced   him \nand    sought    to    restrain    his    impetuosity. \n\"Beloved  brother,  as  soon  as  the  period  of  \nthirteen   years   is   over,   Arjuna,   the   hero, \nwith   the   Gandiva   bow,   and   yourself   will \nfight   and   kill   Duryodhana.   Be   patient   till \nthen.   Duryodhana   and   his   followers,   who \nare  sunk  in  sin,  cannot  escape.  Be  assured  \nof   it.\"   While   the   sorrow-stricken  brothers \nwere   thus   engaged   in   debate,   the   great \nsage  Brihadaswa  came  to  the  hermitage  of \nthe   Pandavas   and   was   received   with   the \ncustomary honors.  \nAfter   a   while,   Yudhishthira   said   to   him: \n\"Revered    sage,    our    deceitful    enemies, \ndrew  us  into  this  game  of  dice  and  cheated  \nus  of  our  kingdom  and  riches,  and  drove \nmy   heroic   brothers,   as   well   as   Panchali \nand  myself,  to  the  forest.  Arjuna,  who  left  \nus  a  long  time  ago  to  get  divine  weapons,  \nhas  not  returned  as  yet  and  we  miss  him \nsorely.   Will   he   return   with   divine   arms? \nAnd  when  will  he  be  back?  Surely  never \nwas    there    in    this    world    a    man    who \nsuffered so much sorrow as myself.\"  \nThe  great  sage  replied:  \"Do  not  let  your \nmind  dwell  on  sorrow.  Arjuna  will  return \nwith  divine  weapons  and  you  will  conquer  \nyour   enemies   in   the   fitness   of   time.   You \nsay  that  there  is  no  one  in  this  world  that  \nis  as  unfortunate  as  you.  Now,  that  is  not  \ntrue,   though   everyone,   tried   by   adversity, \nis    inclined    to    claim    pre-eminence    in \nsorrow,  because  things  felt  are  more  than \nthings  heard  or  seen.  Have  you  heard  of \nking  Nala  of  Nishadha?  He  suffered  more  \nsorrows   than   yourself   even   in   the   forest. \nHe  was  deceived  by  Pushkara  at  a  game \nof  dice.  He  lost  his  wealth  and  kingdom \nand  had  to  go  in  exile  to  the  forest.  Less  \nfortunate   than   you,   he   had   not   with   him \nhis   brothers   or   brahmanas.   The   influence \nof  Kali,  the  spirit  of  the  dark  age,  deprived  \nhim  of  his  discrimination  and  good  sense. \nAnd  not  knowing  what  he  was  doing,  he \ndeserted   his   wife   who   had   accompanied \nhim,   and   wandered   about   in   the   forest, \nsolitary   and   almost   mad.   Now,   compare \nyour    state    with    his.    You    have    the \ncompany    of    your    heroic    brothers    and \ndevoted  wife  and  are  supported  by  a  few \nlearned     brahmanas     in     your     adversity. \nYour  mind  is  sound  and  steady.  Self-pity \nis  natural,  but  you  are  really  not  so  badly \noff.\"  \nThe   sage   then   narrated   the   life   of   Nala \nwhich   constitutes   twenty-eight   chapters   of \nthe   great   epic.   The   sage   concluded   with \nthese words:  \n\"O  Pandava,  Nala  was  tried  by  sorrows \nmore     agonising     than     yours,     yet     he \n\ntriumphed  over  them  all  and  his  life  ended  \nhappily.    You    have    the    alleviations    of \nunclouded  intellect  and  the  society  of  your  \nnearest  and  dearest.  You  spend  much  of \nyour    time    in    exalted    contemplation    of \ndharma     and     in     holy     converse     with \nbrahmanas  who  are  learned  in  the  Vedas \nand    Vedantas.    Bear    your    trials    and \ntribulations  with  fortitude,  for  they  are  the \nlot of man and not peculiar to you.\"  \nThus   did   the   sage   Brihadaswa   console \nYudhishthira. \n",

It  was  difficult \nto maintain such a large establishment.  \nSome  time  after  Arjuna  had  gone  on  his \nquest  of  Pasupata,  a  brahmana  sage  named  \nLomasa    came    to    the    abode    of    the \nPandavas.  \nHe   advised   Yudhishthira   to   minimize   his \nretinue   before   going   on   pilgrimage   as   it \nwould   be   difficult   to   move   freely   from \nplace to place with a large following. \nYudhishthira,    who    had    long    felt    that \ndifficulty,   announced   to   his   followers   that \nsuch   of   them,   as   were   unaccustomed   to \nhardship  and  to  hard  and  scanty  fare  and \nthose   who   had   followed   merely   in   token \nof   loyalty,   might   return   to   Dhritarashtra \nor,  if  they  preferred  it,  go  to  Drupada,  the  \nKing of Panchala.  \nLater,  with  a  greatly  reduced  retinue,  the \nPandavas  started  on  a  pilgrimage  to  holy \nplaces,    acquainting    themselves    with    the \nstories  and  traditions  relating  to  each.  The  \nstory of Agastya was one such. \nAgastya,    it    is said,    once    saw    some \nancestral   spirits   dangling   head   down   and \nasked  them  who  they  were  and  how  they \nhad come to be in that unpleasant plight.  \nThey   replied:   \"Dear   child,   we   are   your \nancestors.  If  you  discharge  not  your  debt \nto  us  by  marrying  and  begetting  progeny, \nthere  will  be  no  one  after  you  to  offer  us  \noblations.  We  have,  therefore,  resorted  to \nthis  austerity,  in  order  to  persuade  you  to  \nsave us from this peril.\"  \nWhen  Agastya  heard  this,  he  decided  to \nmarry. \nThe  king  of  the  country  of  Vidarbha  was \nchildless  and,  so,  careworn.  He  repaired  to  \nAgastya   to   get   his   blessing.   In   granting \nhim  the  boon,  Agastya  announced  that  the  \nking   would   be   the   father   of   a   beautiful \ngirl,  who,  he  stipulated  should  be  given  in \nmarriage to him.  \nSoon  the  queen  gave  birth  to  a  girl  who  \nwas   named   Lopamudra.   She   grew   with \nyears   into   a   maiden   of   such   rare   beauty \nand  charm  that  she  became  celebrated  in \nthe  kshatriya  world.  But  no  prince  dared \nto woo her for fear of Agastya.  \nLater,  the  sage  Agastya  came  to  Vidarbha  \nand   demanded   the   hand   of   the   king's \ndaughter.   The   king   was   reluctant   to   give \nthe      delicately      nurtured      princess      in \nmarriage   to   a   sage   leading   the   primitive \nlife   of   a   forester   but   he   also   feared   the \nanger  of  the  sage  if  he  said  nay,  and  was  \nplunged in sorrow.  \nLopamudra,  greatly  concerned,  discovered \nthe  cause  of  her  parent's  unhappiness  and \nexpressed  her  readiness,  nay  her  desire,  to  \nmarry the sage.  \nThe   king   was   relieved,   and   the   marriage \nof  Agastya  and  Lopamudra  was  celebrated  \nin  due  course.  When  the  princess  set  out \nto  accompany  the  sage,  he  bade  her  give  \nup    her    costly    garments    and    valuable \njewels.  \nUnquestioningly      Lopamudra      distributed \nher  priceless  jewels  and  garments  amongst  \nher     companions     and     attendants,     and \ncovering  herself  in  deerskin  and  garments \nof    bark,    she    joyfully accompanied   the \nsage.  \nDuring   the   time   Lopamudra   and   Agastya \nspent     in     tapas     and     meditation     at \nGangadwara,   a   strong   and   abiding   love \nsprang   up   between   them.   For   conjugal \n\nlife,    Lopamudra's    modesty    shrank    from \nthe  lack  of  privacy  in  a  forest  hermitage. \nAnd     one     day,     with     blushing     and \nhumbleness  she  expressed  her  mind  to  her  \nhusband. \nShe  said:  \"My  desire  is  that  I  may  have \nthe  royal  bedding,  the  beautiful  robes  and \nthe  valuable  jewels  I  had  when  I  was  in \nmy   father's   place   and   that   you   too   may \nhave    splendid    garments   and   ornaments. \nAnd  then  we  shall  enjoy  life  to  our  heart's  \ncontent.\" \nAgastya   smilingly   replied:   \"I   have   neither \nthe   wealth   nor   the   facilities   to   provide \nwhat  you  want.  Are  we  not  beggars  living \nin the forest?\" \nBut   Lopamudra   knew   her   lord's   yogic \npower,    and    said:    \"Lord,    you    are    all-\npowerful     by     the     strength     of     your \nausterities.  You  can  get  the  wealth  of  the \nwhole world in a moment if you but will.\" \nAgastya  said  that  no  doubt  that  was  so, \nbut,   if   he   spent   his   austerities   in   gaining \nthings   of   such   little   moment   as   riches, \nthey would soon dwindle to nothing.  \nShe  replied:  \"I  do  not  wish  that.  What  I \ndesire   is   that   you   should   earn   in   the \nordinary   way   sufficient   wealth   for   us   to \nlive in ease and comfort.\" \nAgastya   consented   and   set   out   as   an \nordinary    brahmana    to    beg    of    various \nkings.   Agastya   went   to   a   king   who   was \nreputed  to  be  very  wealthy.  The  sage  told  \nthe  king:  \"I  have  come  in  quest  of  wealth.  \nGive  me  what  I  seek,  without  causing  any \nloss or injury to others.\" \nThe  king  presented  a  true  picture  of  the \nincome   and  expenditure  of  the  State  and \ntold   him   he   was   free   to   take   what   he \ndeemed    fit.    The    sage    found    from    the \naccounts that there was no balance left.  \nThe    expenditure    of    a    State    turns    out \nalways  to  be  at  least  equal  to  its  income.  \nThis   seems   to   have   been   the   case   in \nancient times also. \nSeeing  this,  Agastya  said:  \"To  accept  any \ngift  from  this  king,  will  be  a  hardship  to \nthe   citizens.   So,   I   shall   seek   elsewhere,\" \nand  the  sage  was  about  to  leave.  The  king  \nsaid   that   he   would   also   accompany   him \nand   both   of   them   went  to  another  State \nwhere  also  they  found  the  same  state  of \naffairs.  \nVyasa   thus   lays   down   and   illustrates   the \nmaxim   that   a   king   should   not   tax   his \nsubjects   more   than   necessary   for   rightful \npublic  expenditure  and  that  if  one  accepts \nas   gift   anything   from   the  public  revenues, \none  adds  to  the  burden  of  the  subjects  to  \nthat extent.  \nAgastya  thought  he  had  better  go  to  the \nwicked    asura    Ilvala    and    try    his    luck.  \nIlvala  and  his  brother  Vatapi  cherished  an \nimplacable     hatred     towards     brahmanas. \nThey   had   curious   plan   for   killing   them. \nIlvala    would,    with    effective    hospitality, \ninvite a brahmana to a feast.  \nBy   the   power   of   his   magic   he   would \ntransform   his   brother   Vatapi   into   a   goat \nand   he   would   kill   this   pseudo-goat   for \nfood  and  serve  its  meat  to  the  guest.  In \nthose   days,   the   brahmanas   used   to   eat \nmeat.  The  feast  over,  Ilvala  would  invoke \nhis  brother  Vatapi  to  come  out,  for  he  had  \nthe   art   of   bringing   back   to   life   those \nwhom he had killed.  \nAnd  Vatapi,  who  as  food  had  entered  the  \nvitals    of    the    unlucky    brahmana,    would \nspring  up  sound  and  whole  and  rend  his \nway   out   with   fiendish   laughter,   of   course \nkilling the guest in doing so.  \nIn  this  manner,  many  brahmanas  had  died.  \nIlvala  was  very  happy  when  he  learnt  that  \nAgastya   was   in   the   neighborhood,   since \nhe   felt   that   here   was   a   good   brahmana \ndelivered into his hands.  \nSo,   he   welcomed   him   and   prepared   the \nusual  feast.  The  sage  ate  heartily  of  Vatapi  \ntransformed    into    a    goat,    and    it    only \nremained  for  Ilvala  to  call  out  Vatapi  for \nthe   rending   scene.   And,   as   usual,   Ilvala \n\nrepeated   the   magic   formula   and   shouted: \n\"Vatapi come out!\" \nAgastya   smiled   and,   gently   rubbing   his \nstomach,  said:  \"O  Vatapi,  be  digested  in \nmy  stomach  for  the  peace  and  good  of  the  \nworld.\"   Ilvala   shouted   again   and   again   in \nfrantic fear: \"O Vatapi, come forth.\"  \nThere    was   no   response   and   the   sage \nexplained   the   reason.   Vatapi   had   been \ndigested.  The  trick  had  been  tried  once  too  \noften. \nThe     asura     bowed     to     Agastya     and \nsurrendered   to   him   the   riches   he   sought. \nThus    was    the    sage    able    to    satisfy \nLopamudra's   desire.   Agastya   asked   her \nwhat    she    would    prefer    whether    ten \nordinarily   good   sons   or   one   super-good \nson with the strength of ten.  \nLopamudra  replied  she  would  like  to  have  \none    exceptionally    virtuous    and    learned \nson.  The  story  goes  that  she  was  blessed \nwith such a gifted son. \nOnce  the  Vindhyas  became  jealous  of  the  \nMeru    Mountain    and    tried    to    grow    in \nstature,  obstructing  the  sun,  the  moon  and  \nthe  planets.  Unable  to  prevent  this  danger,  \nthe   gods   sought   aid   from   Agastya.   The \nsage   went   to   the   Vindhya   Mountain   and \nsaid:  \n\"Best   of   mountains,   stop   you’re   growing \ntill  I  cross  you  on  my  way  to  the  south  and  \nreturn   north   again.   After   my   return,   you \ncan   grow,   as   you   like.   Wait   till   then.\" \nSince    the    Vindhya    Mountain    respected \nAgastya, it bowed to his request.  \nAgastya   did   not   return   north   at   all,   but \nsettled  in  the  south  and  so  the  Vindhyas \nremain   arrested   in   growth   to   this   day. \nSuch    is    the    story    as    narrated    in    the \nMahabharata. \n",

Virtue  guarded  only  by \nignorance  is  very  insecure  as  illustrated  by \nthe    following    story.    It    is    told    in    the \nRamayana also, but not in the same detail.  \nVibhandaka    who    was    resplendent    like \nBrahma,   the   Creator,   lived with   his   son \nRishyasringa  in  a  forest.  The  latter  had  not  \ncome  across  any  mortal,  man  or  woman, \nexcept his father.  \nThe   country   of   Anga   was   once   afflicted \nwith  a  dire  famine.  Crops  had  withered  for  \nwant  of  rain  and  men  perished  for  lack  of \nfood.   All   living   things   were   in   distress. \nRomapada,    the    king    of    the    country, \napproached   the   brahmanas   to   advise   him \nof   some   means   of   saving   the   kingdom \nfrom famine.  \nThe   brahmanas   replied:   \"Best   of   kings, \nthere  is  a  young  sage  called  Rishyasringa \nwho  lives  a  life  of  perfect  chastity.  Invite \nhim   to   our   kingdom.   He   has   won   the \npower,  by  his  austerities,  of  bringing  rain \nand plenty wherever he goes.\"  \nThe   king   discussed   with   his   courtiers   the \nmeans   by   which   Rishyasringa   could   be \nbrought   from   the   hermitage   of   the   sage \nVibhandaka.    In    accordance    with    their \nadvice,    he    called    together    the    most \ncharming    courtesans    of    the    city    and \nentrusted     them     with     the     mission     of \nbringing Rishyasringa to Anga.  \nThe  damsels  were  in  a  quandary.  On  the \none  hand,  they  feared  to  disobey  the  king.  \nOn  the  other,  they  also  feared  the  sage's \nwrath.   Finally,   they   made   up   their   minds \nto  go,  relying  on  Providence  to  help  them,  \nin   achieving   the   good   work   of   rescuing \nthe stricken land from famine.  \nThey    were    suitably    equipped    for    their \nenterprise     before     being     sent     to     the \nhermitage.      The   leader   of   this   band   of \ncourtesans   made   a   beautiful   garden   of   a \nbig  boat,  with  artificial  trees  and  creepers,  \nwith an imitation ashrama in the center.  \nShe  had  the  boat  moored  in  the  river  near  \nVibhandaka's        hermitage,        and        the \ncourtesans     visited     the     hermitage     with \nquaking  hearts.  Luckily  for  them,  the  sage  \n\nwas  not  at  home.  Feeling  that  this  was  the  \nopportune   moment,   one   of   the   beautiful \ndamsels went to the sage's son. \nShe   thus   addressed   Rishyasringa:   \"Great \nsage,   are   you   well?   Have   you   sufficient \nroots  and  fruits?  Are  the  penances  of  the \nrishis       of       the       forest       proceeding \nsatisfactorily?     Is     your     father's     glory \nconstantly  growing?  Is  your  own  study  of \nthe   Vedas   progressing?\"   This   was   how \nrishis  used  to  accost  one  another  in  those  \ndays.  \nThe   youthful   anchorite   had   never   before \nseen  such  a  beautiful  human  form  or  heard  \nsuch a sweet voice.  \nThe     instinctive     yearning     for     society, \nespecially  of  the  opposite  sex,  though  he \nhad  never  seen  a  woman  before,  began  to  \nwork   on   his   mind   from   the   moment   he \nbeheld that graceful form. \nHe  thought  that  she  was  a  young  sage  like  \nhimself,  and  felt  a  strange  irrepressible  joy \nsurging    up    in    his    soul.    He    answered, \nfixing eyes on his interlocutor:  \n\"You   seem   to   be   a   bright   brahmacharin. \nWho  are  you?  I  bow  to  you.  Where  is \nyour   hermitage?   What   are   the   austerities \nyou  are  practising?\"  and  he  rendered  her \nthe customary offerings. \nShe  said  to  him:  \"At  a  distance  of  three \nyojanas  from  here  is  my  ashrama.  I  have \nbrought   fruits   for   you.   I   am   not   fit   to \nreceive  your  prostration,  but  I  shall  return \nyour   greetings   and   salutation   in   the   way \ncustomary   with   us.\"   She   embraced   him \nwarmly,  fed  him  with  the  sweets  she  had \nbrought,    decorated    him    with    perfumed \ngarlands, and served him with drinks.  \nShe  embraced  him  again,  saying  that  that \nwas   their   way   of   salutation   to   honored \nguests.   He   thought   it   a   very   agreeable \nway. \nShortly  after,  fearing  the  return  of  the  sage  \nVibhandaka,  the  courtesan  took  her  leave \nof  Rishyasringa  saying  it  was  time  for  her \nto    perform    the    agnihotra    sacrifice    and \ngently slipped out of the hermitage. \nWhen     Vibhandaka     returned     to     the \nhermitage,   he   was   shocked   to   see   the \nplace  so  untidy  with  sweet  meats  scattered  \nall   over,   for   the   hermitage   had   not   been \ncleansed.  The  shrubs  and  creepers  looked  \ndraggled and untidy. \nHis  son's  face  had  not  its  usual  lustre  but  \nseemed   clouded   and   disturbed   as   by   a \nstorm  of  passion.  The  usual  simple  duties \nof the hermitage had been neglected. \nVibhandaka   was   troubled   and   asked   his \nson:   \"Dear   boy,   why   have   you   not   yet \ngathered   the   sacred   firewood?   Who   has \nbroken  these  nice  plants  and  shrubs?  Has \nthe   cow   been   milked?   Has   anyone   been \nhere   to   serve   you?   Who   gave   you   this \nstrange    garland?    Why    do    you    appear \nworried?\" \nThe    simple    and    ingenuous    Rishyasringa \nreplied:    \"A    brahmacharin    of    wonderful \nform    was here.   I   cannot   describe   his \nbrightness  and  beauty  or  the  sweetness  of \nhis  voice.  My  inner  being  has  been  filled \nwith   indescribable   happiness   and   affection \nby  listening  to  his  voice  and  looking  at  his  \neyes.   When   he   embraced   me,   which   it \nseems     is     his     customary     greeting,     I \nexperienced  a  joy  which  I  have  never  felt  \nbefore,   no,   not   even   when   eating   the \nsweetest  fruits,\"  and  then  he  described  to \nhis  father  the  form,  beauty  and  the  doings  \nof his fair visitor.  \nRishyasringa   added   wistfully:   \"My   body \nseems  to  burn  with  desire  for  the  company  \nof  that  brahmacharin  and  I  should  like  to \ngo    and    find    him    and    bring    him    here \nsomehow.  How  can  I  give  you  any  idea \nabout   his   devotion   and   brightness?   My \nheart pants to see him.\"  \nWhen    Rishyasringa    had    thus    brokenly \nexpressed   yearnings   and   disturbances   to \nwhich   he   had   hitherto   been   a   stranger, \nVibhandaka  knew  what  had  occurred.  He \nsaid:   \"Child,   this   was   no   brahmacharin \n\nthat  you  saw,  but  a  malignant  demon  who  \nsought,  as  demons  do,  to  beguile  us  and \nhinder  our  penances  and  austerities.  They \ntake  recourse  to  many  kinds  of  tricks  and  \nstratagems   for   the   purpose.   Do   not   let \nthem come near you.\"  \nAfter   that   Vibhandaka   searched   in   vain \nfor  three  days  in  the  forest  to  find  out  the  \nwretches   who   had   done   this   injury,   and \nreturned baffled it his purpose. \nOn   another   occasion,   when   Vibhandaka \nhad   gone   out   of   the   hermitage   to   bring \nroots  and  fruits,  the  courtesan  again  came \nsoftly    to    the    place    where    Rishyasringa \nwas  seated.  As  soon  as  he  saw  her  at  a \ndistance,  Rishyasringa  jumped  up  and  ran \nto   greet   her   gushingly,   as   pent   up   water \nsurges  out  of  a  reservoir  that  has  sprung  a  \nleak. \nEven   without   waiting   for   prompting   this \ntime,  Rishyasringa  went  near  her  and  after  \nthe  customary  salutation  said:    \"O  shining \nbrahmacharin,  before  my  father  returns  let \nus go to your hermitage.\" \nThis   was   just   what   she   had   hoped   and \nworked  for.  And  together  they  entered  the  \nboat,  which  had  been  made  to  look  like  a  \nhermitage.  As  soon  as  the  young  sage  had  \nentered,    the    boat    was    freed    from    its \nmoorings  and  floated  easily  down  with  its  \nwelcome freight to the kingdom of Anga.  \nAs  might  be  expected,  the  young  sage  had  \na    pleasant    and    interesting    journey    and \nwhen  he  reached  Anga,  he  certainly  knew \nmore  about  the  world  and  its  ways  than  he  \nhad done in the forest.  \nThe    coming    of    Rishyasringa    delighted \nRomapada    infinitely    and    he    took    his \nwelcome  guest  to  the  luxuriously  provided \ninner    apartments    specially    prepared    for \nhim.  \nAs  foretold  by  the  brahmanas,  rain  began \nto   pour   the   instant   Rishyasringa   set   his \nfoot   in   the   country.   The   rivers   and   the \nlakes   were   full   and   the   people   rejoiced. \nRomapada   gave   his   daughter   Shanta   in \nmarriage to Rishyasringa. \nThough  all  ended  as  he  had  planned,  the \nking  was  uneasy  in  his  mind,  for  he  was \nafraid    that    Vibhandaka    might    come    in \nsearch  of  his  son  and  pronounce  a  curse  \non him.  \nSo,   he   sought   to   mollify   Vibhandaka   by \nlining  the  route  he  would  take  with  cattle \nand  kind  and  by  instructing  the  cowherds \nin     charge     to     say     that     they     were \nRishyasringa's   servants   and   had   come   to \nwelcome   and   honor   their   master's   father \nand place themselves at his service.  \nNot    finding    his    son    anywhere    in    the \nhermitage,      the      enraged      Vibhandaka \nthought  that  this  might  be  the  work  of  the  \nking of Anga.  \nHe  crossed  intervening  rivers  and  villages \nand  marched  to  the  capital  of  the  king  as  if  \nto  burn  him  in  his  anger.  But  as  at  each \nstage   of   the   journey   he   saw   magnificent \ncattle  which  belonged  to  his  son  and  was \nrespectfully     welcomed     by     his     son's \nservants,  his  angry  mood  passed  gradually \nas he approached the capital.  \nWhen   he   came   to   the   capital,   he   was \nreceived  with  great  honor  and  taken  to  the  \nking's  palace  where  he  saw  his  son  sitting \nin   state   like   the   king   of   the   gods   in \nheaven.  He  saw  by  his  side  his  wife,  the \nprincess     Shanta,     whose     great     beauty \nsoothed and pleased him. \nVibhandaka  blessed  the  king.  He  laid  this  \ninjunction   on   his   son:   \"Do   all   that   will \nplease  this  king.  After  the  birth  of  a  son, \ncome     and     join     me     in     the     forest.\" \nRishyasringa did as his father bade him. \nLomasa   concluded   the   story   with   these \nwords   addressed   to   Yudhishthira:   \"Like \nDamayanti    and    Nala,    Sita    and    Rama, \nArundhati   and   Vasishtha,   Lopamudra   and \nAgastya,    and    Draupadi    and    yourself, \nShanta   and   Rishyasringa   repaired   to   the \nforest   in   the   fullness   of   time   and   spent \ntheir  lives  in  mutual  love  and  the  worship \n\nof    God.    This    is    the    hermitage    where \nRishyasringa.  lived.  Bathe  in  these  waters \nand   be   purified.\"   The   Pandavas   bathed \nthere and performed their devotions. \n",

Raibhya   and   his   two \nsons,   Paravasu   and   Arvavasu,   learnt   the \nVedas     and     became     famed     scholars. \nBharadwaja  devoted  himself  wholly  to  the \nworship   of   God.

Yavakrida      practised      hard \npenance   to   gain   the   grace   of   Indra.   He \ntortured  his  body  with  austerities  and  thus \nawakened   the   compassion   of   Indra,   who \nappeared    and    asked    him    why    he    so \nmortified his flesh.\"   \nYavakrida   replied:   \"I   wish   to   be   more \nlearned   in   the   Vedas   than   any   has   ever \nbeen  before.  I  wish  to  be  a  great  scholar.  I  \nam   performing   these   austerities   to   realise \nthat   desire.   It   takes   a   long   time   and \ninvolves  much  hardship  to  learn  the  Vedas  \nfrom  a  teacher.  I  am  practising  austerities \nto   acquire   that   knowledge   directly.   Bless \nme.\"  \nIndra  smiled  and  said:  \"O  brahmana,  you \nare  on  the  wrong  path.  Return  home,  seek  \na   proper   preceptor   and   learn   the   Vedas \nfrom   him.   Austerity   is   not   the   way   to \nlearning.   The   path   is   study   and   study \nalone.\"  With  these  words  Indra  vanished. \nBut  the  son  of  Bharadwaja  would  not  give  \nup.  \nHe  pursued  his  course  of  austerities  with \neven  greater  rigor,  to  the  horror  and  the \ndistress     of     the     gods.     Indra     again \nmanifested   himself   before   Yavakrida   and \nwarned him again:  \n\"You    have    taken    the    wrong    path    to \nacquire    knowledge.    You    can    acquire \nknowledge   only   by   study.   Your   father \nlearnt  the  Vedas  by  patient  study  and  so \ncan  you.  Go  and  study  the  Vedas.  Desist \nfrom this vain mortification of the body.\" \nYavakrida  did  not  heed  even  this  second \nwarning  of  Indra  and  announced  defiantly \nthat   if   his   prayer   were   not   granted,   he \nwould   cut   off   his   limbs   one   by   one   and \noffer  them  as  oblations  to  the  fire.  No,  he  \nwould never give up. \nHe   continued   his   penance.   One   morning, \nduring   his   austerities,   when   he   went   to \nbathe  in  the  Ganga,  be  saw  a  gaunt  old \nbrahmana     on     the     bank,     laboriously \nthrowing handfuls of sand into the water.  \nYavakrida  asked:  \"Old  man,  what  are  you \ndoing?\" The  old  man  replied:  \"I  am  going \nto   build   a   dam   across   this   river.   When, \nwith   handful   after   handful,   I   have   built   a \ndam  of  sand  here,  people  can  cross  the \nriver  with  ease.  See  how  very  difficult  it  is  \nat  present  to  cross  it.  Useful  work,  isn't \nit?\"  \nYavakrida  laughed  and  said:  \"What  a  fool \nyou  must  be  to  think  you  can  build  a  dam  \n\nacross   this   mighty   river   with   your   silly \nhandfuls  of  sand!  Arise  and  take  to  some  \nmore useful work.\" \nThe   old   man   said:   \"Is   my   project   more \nfoolish  than  yours  of  mastering  the  Vedas \nnot     by     study     but     by     austerities?\" \nYavakrida  now  knew  that  the  old  man  was  \nIndra.   More   humble   this   time,   Yavakrida \nearnestly    begged    Indra    to    grant    him \nlearning as a personal boon. \nIndra   blessed,   and   comforted   Yavakrida \nwith the following words: \n\"Well,  I  grant  you  the  boon  you  seek.  Go  \nand   study   the   Vedas;   you   will   become \nlearned.\" \n",

      "content": "\nYAVAKRIDA    studied    the    Vedas    and \nbecame   learned.   He   grew   vain   with   the \nthought     that     he     had     acquired     the \nknowledge  of  the  Vedas  through  the  boon \nof Indra and not through human tutelage.  \nBharadwaja   did   not   like   this   and   feared \nthat     his     son     might     ruin     himself     by \nslighting  Raibhya.  He  thought  it  necessary \nto  warm  him.  \"The  gods,\"  he  said,  \"grant \nboons   to   foolish   people   who   persistently \npractise   penances,   as   intoxicants  are  sold \nto  fools  for  money.  They  lead  to  loss  of \nself-control,  and  this  leads  to  the  warping \nof   the   mind   and   utter   destruction.\"   He \nillustrated   his   advice   by   the   ancient   tale, \nwhich is given below. \nIn  olden  times  there  was  a  celebrated  sage  \nnamed   Baladhi.   He   had   a   son   whose \nuntimely  death  plunged  him  into  grief.  So, \nbe  practised  rigorous  penance  to  get  a  son  \nwho would never meet with death.  \nThe   gods   told   the   sage   that   this   could \nnever    be,    for    the    human    race    was \nnecessarily  mortal,  and  there  need  must  be \na  limit  to  human  life.  They  asked  him  to \nname his own limit.  \nThe  sage  replied:  \"In  that  case  grant  that \nthe  life  of  my  son  may  persist  as  long  as \nthat    mountain    lasts.\"    The    boon    was \ngranted  to  him  and  he  was  duly  blessed \nwith a son named Medhavi. \nMedhavi   grew   conceited   at   the   thought \nthat  he  was  safe  from  death  forever,  since  \nhe   would   live   as   long   as   the   mountain \nexisted,   and   he   behaved   with   arrogance \ntowards all.  \nOne  day,  this  vain  man  showed  disrespect  \nto  a  great  sage  named  Dhanushaksha.  At \nonce   that sage   cursed   that   he   might   be \nturned   to   ashes,   but   the   curse   took   no \neffect    on    Medhavi    who    remained    in \nperfect health.  \nSeeing    this,    the    high-souled    sage    was \npuzzled    and    then    remembered    the    gift \nMedhavi  had  been  endowed  with  at  birth.    \nDhanushaksha   took   the   form   of   a   wild \nbuffalo  and  by  the  power  of  his  penances  \nbutted   at   the   mountain   and   broke   it   to \npieces and Medhavi fell down dead.  \nBharadwaja  concluded  the  story  with  this \nsolemn     warning     to     his     son:     \"Learn \nwisdom  from  this  old  story.  Be  not  ruined  \nby   vanity.   Cultivate   self-restraint.   Do   not \ntransgress  the  limits  of  good  conduct  and \ndo    not    be    disrespectful    to    the    great \nRaibhya.\"  \nIt  was  springtime.  The  trees  and  creepers \nwere  beautiful  with  flowers  and  the  whole \nforest  was  gorgeous  with  color  and  sweet  \nwith the song of birds.  \nThe   very   earth   seemed   to   be   under   the \nspell  of  the  god  of  love.  Paravasu's  wife \nwas  strolling  alone  in  the  garden  near  the \nhermitage  of  Raibhya.  She  appeared  more  \nthan  human,  in  the  sweet  union  in  her  of \nbeauty, courage and purity.  \nAt   that   time   Yavakrida   came   there   and \nwas   so   overwhelmed   by   her   loveliness \nthat  he  completely  lost  his  sense  and  self-\ncontrol   and   became   as   a   ravening   beast \nwith lust.  \nHe     accosted     her     and     taking     brutal \nadvantage   of   her   fear   and   shame   and \nbewilderment,  he  dragged  her  to  a  lonely \npot and violated her person.  \n\nRaibhya  returned  to  his  hermitage.  He  saw \nhis    daughter    in-law    weeping,    broken-\nhearted   and   inconsolable   and   learning   of \nthe   shameful   outrage   perpetrated   on   her, \nhe  was  seized  with  implacable  anger.  He \nplucked  a  hair  from  his  bead  and  offered  it  \nto the fire reciting a mantra.  \nAt   once,   a   maiden,   as   beautiful   as   his \ndaughter-in-law,       emerged       from       the \nsacrificial fire.  \nThe   sage   plucked   another   hair   from   his \nknotted  lock  and  offered  it  as  oblation.  A \nterrible  ghost  rose  from  the  fire.  The  sage  \ncommanded  them  to  kill  Yavakrida.  Both \nof them bowed to the order.  \nWhile    Yavakrida    was    performing    the \nmorning  rites,  the  female  spirit  went  near \nhim   and   with   smiles   and   allurements   put \nhim   off   his   guard   and   as   she   ran   away \nwith  his  water-jug,  the  male  ghost  rushed \non him with uplifted spear.  \nYavakrida  stood  up  in  fear.  Knowing  that  \nhis  mantras  would  be  of  no  avail  until  he \ncleansed  himself  with  water,  he  looked  for  \nhis   water-jug.   When   he   found   it   missing, \nhe  rushed  to  a  pond  for  water  but  the  pond  \nwas  dry.  He  went  to  nearby  stream,  which  \nalso dried up at his approach.  \nThere   was   no   water   for   him   anywhere. \nThe       terrible       fiend       pursued       him \neverywhere   and   Yavakrida   fled   for   his \nlife,  with  the  demon  hot  on  his  heels.  His \nsin  had  consumed  the  power  of  his  vigils \nand  fasts.  At  last,  he  sought  refuge  in  the  \nsacrificial hall of his father.  \nThe  half-blind  man  who  was  guarding  the \nhermitage   stopped   him   as   be   could   not \nrecognise    Yavakrida    as,    distorted    with \nmortal  fear,  he  sought  to  force  his  way  in.  \nMeanwhile,   the   fiend   overtook   him   and \nkilled him with his spear. \nWhen      Bharadvaja      returned      to      his \nhermitage,  he  came  upon  his  son's  corpse \nand  concluded  that  disrespect  to  Raibhya \nmust have led to this cruel fate.  \n\"Alas!   My   child,   you   died of  your  pride \nand  vanity.  Was  it  not  a  great  mistake  that  \nyou  tried  to  learn  the  Vedas  in  a  way  not  \nresorted   to   by   any   brahmana?   Why   did \nyou  behave  so  as  to  be  cursed  thus?  May  \nRaibhya,  who  caused  the  death  of  my  only  \nson,  be  himself  killed  by  one  of  his  sons!\" \nThus,  carried  away  by  rage  and  grief  the \nsage cursed Raibhya.  \nRegaining   control   soon,   he   exclaimed   in \nanguish:   \"Alas!   They   alone   are   blessed \nwho  have  no  sons.  I  have  not  only  lost  my  \nonly  son,  but  in  the  madness  of  my  grief  I  \nhave      also      cursed      my      friend     and \ncompanion.  What  is  the  use  of  continuing \nmy  life?\"  He  cremated  his  son's  body  and  \ndied   by   throwing   himself   on   the   funeral \npyre. \n",

Near  the  hermitage,  he  saw  in  the \ntwilight,   what   seemed   to   him   a   beast   of \nprey   crouching   for   a   spring   and,   hurling \nhis weapon at it, killed it.  \nBut  to  his  horror  and  grief,  he  discovered  \nthat  he  had  killed  his  own  father  clad  in \nskins,  mistaking  him  for  a  wild  denizen  of \nthe    forest.    He    realised    that    the    fatal \nmistake   was   the   effect   of   the   curse   of \nBharadwaja.  \nWhen    he    had    hastily    performed    the \nfuneral   rites   of   his   father,   he   went   to \nArvavasu  and  told  him  the  doleful  tale.  He  \nsaid:  \"But  this  mishap  should  not  interfere \nwith   the   sacrifice   of   the   king.   Please   do \n\nthe  rites  on  my  behalf  in  expiation  of  the \nsin   I   have   unwittingly   committed.

If  you  can  be  my \nsubstitute      here      for      undergoing      the \nexpiation  I  shall  be  able  to  go  and  assist  in  \nconducting    the    king's    sacrifice.    I    can \nofficiate   unaided,   which   is   a   thing   you \ncannot do as yet.\"  \nThe    virtuous    brother    agreed    and    said: \n\"You  may  attend  to  the  king's  sacrifice.  I \nshall   do   penance   to   free   you   from   the \nterrible  taint  of  having  killed  a  father  and \na brahmana.\"  \nThe   virtuous   Arvavasu,   accordingly,   took \nupon  himself  the  expiatory  rites  on  behalf \nof  his  brother.  That  done,  he  came  to  the  \ncourt  of  the  king  to  join  his  brother  and \nassist in the sacrifice. \nThe  sin  of  Paravasu  was  not  washed  off, \nsince   expiation   cannot   be   by   proxy.   It \ntainted his mind with wicked designs.  \nBecoming   jealous   of   the   radiance   on   his \nbrother's     face,     Paravasu     decided     to \ndishonor    him    by    casting    on    him    an \nunjustice   as   a   person   and   accordingly, \nwhen  Arvavasu  entered  the  hall,  Paravasu \nloudly   exclaimed   so   that   the   king   might \nhear:  \n\"This    man    has    committed    the    sin    of \nkilling  a  brahmana  and  how  can  he  enter \nthis holy sacrificial place?\" \nArvavasu        indignantly        denied        the \naccusation   but   none   heeded   him,   and   he \nwas   ignominiously   expelled   from   that   hall \nof sacrifice by the orders of the king.  \nArvavasu       repeatedly       protested       his \ninnocence.   \"It   is   my   brother   who   has \ncommitted   the   sin   and   even   then   it   was \nthrough   a   mistake.   I   have   saved   him   by \nperforming expiatory rites.\"  \nThis   made   matters   worse   for   him   for \nnobody  believed  that  the  expiation  he  had  \nundergone  was  not  for  his  own  crime  and  \neveryone  thought  that  he  was  adding  false  \naccusation  against  a  blameless  brother,  to \nhis other sins.  \nThe  virtuous  Arvavasu  who,  besides  being \nfalsely  accused  of  a  monstrous  crime,  was  \nalso  slandered  as  a  liar,  retreated  to  the \nforest   in   despair   of   finding   justice   in   the \nworld    and    betook himself    to    rigorous \nausterities.  \nThe   gods   were   gracious   and   asked   him: \n\"O   virtuous   soul,   what   is   the   boon   you \nseek?\"  High  thinking  and  deep  meditation \nhad  in  the  meantime  cleansed  his  heart  of \nall  anger  at  his  brother's  conduct;  and  so,  \nhe   only   prayed   that   his   father   might   be \nrestored  to  life  and  that  his  brother  might \nbe  freed  from  wickedness  and  the  sins  that  \nhe had committed. \nThe gods granted his prayer.  \nLomasa       narrated       this       story       to \nYudhishthira   at   a   place   near   Raibhya's \nhermitage   and   said:   \"O   Pandavas,   bathe \nhere   and   wash   off   your   passions   in   this \nholy river.\" \nArvavasu  and  Paravasu  were  both  sons  of \na  great  scholar.  Both  of  them  learnt  at  his  \nfeet      and      became      eminent      scholars \nthemselves.  \nBut   learning   is   one   thing   and   virtue   is \nquite   another.   It   is   true   that   one   should \nknow   the   difference   between   good   and \nevil,  if  one  is  to  seek  good  and  shun  evil.  \nBut  this  knowledge  should  soak  into  every \nthought   and   influence   every   act   in   one's \nlife.  \nThen   indeed   knowledge   becomes   virtue. \nThe   knowledge   that   is   merely so   much \nundigested   information   crammed   into   the \nmind, cannot instill virtue.  \nIt  is  just  an  outward  show  like  our  clothes  \nand is no real part of us. \n",

Lomasa  told  Yudhishthira  the \nstory of that place. \nUdalaka,   a   great   sage   and   teacher   of \nVedanta,   had   a   disciple   named   Kagola, \nwho  was  virtuous  and  devoted  but  had  no  \ngreat  learning.  So,  the  other  disciples  used  \nto laugh and mock at him.  \nUddalaka,    however,    attached    no    great \nweight   to   his   disciple's   lack   of   erudition \nbut  really  appreciated  his  virtues,  devotion \nand  good  conduct  and  gave  his  daughter \nSujata in marriage to him. \nThe   couple   was   blessed   with   a   son.   A \nchild   generally   inherits   the   characteristics \nof   both   the   parents.   But   fortunately   the \ngrandson    of    Uddalaka    took    after    his \ngrandfather    rather    than    his    father    and \nknew  the  Vedas  even  while  he  was  in  his  \nmother's womb.  \nWhen  Kagola  made  mistakes,  as  he  often \ndid  in  reciting  the  Vedas,  the  child  in  the \nwomb  would  twist  his  body  with  pain,  and  \nso   it   came   to   pass   that   he   had   eight \ncrooked  bends  in  his  body  when  he  was \nborn.  \nThese  crooked  bends  earned  him  the  name  \nof     Ashtavakra,     which     means     \"Eight \ncrooked  bends.\"  Kagola,  one  ill-fated  day,  \nprovoked  a  polemical  contest  with  Vandi, \nthe   court   scholar   of   Mithila,   and,   having \nbeen    defeated,    was    made    to    drown \nhimself. \nMeanwhile   Ashtavakra   grew   up   to   be   a \ntowering  scholar  even  in  his  boyhood,  and  \nat    the    age of   twelve   he   had   already \ncompleted  his  study  of  the  Vedas  and  the  \nVedanta.  \nOne   day,   Ashtavakra   learnt   that   Janaka, \nthe  king  of  Mithila  was  performing  a  great  \nsacrifice    in    the    course    of    which    the \nassembled     scholars     would,     as     usual, \ndebate on the sastras.  \nAshtavakra       set       out       for       Mithila, \naccompanied   by   his   uncle   Svetaketu.   On \ntheir   way   to   the   place   of   sacrifice   at \nMithila,  they  came  across  the  king  and  his  \nretinue.  \nThe   attendants   of   the   king   marched   in \nfront   shouting:   \"Move   away.   Make   way \nfor    the    King.\"    Ashtavakra    instead    of \nmoving    out    of    the    way    said    to    the \nretainers: \n\"O  royal  attendants,  even  the  king,  if  he  is  \nrighteous,  has  to  move  and  make  way  for  \nthe    blind,    the    deformed,    the    fair    sex, \npersons    bearing    loads    and    brahmanas \nlearned   in   the   Vedas.   This   is   the   rule \nenjoined by the scriptures.\"  \nThe  king,  surprised  at  these  wise  words  of  \nthe   brahmana   boy,   accepted   the   justness \nof  the  rebuke  and  made  way,  observing  to  \nhis     attendants:     \"What     this     brahmana \nstripling  says  is  true.  Fire  is  fire  whether  it  \nis   tiny   or big   and   it   has   the   power   to \nburn.\" \nAshtavakra    and    Svetaketu    entered    the \nsacrificial    hall.    The    gatekeeper    stopped \nthem  and  said:  \"Boys  cannot  go  in.  Only \nold  men  learned  in  the  Vedas  may  go  into  \nthe sacrificial hall.\"  \nAshtavakra   replied:   \"We   are   not   mere \nboys.   We   have   observed   the   necessary \nvows   and   have   learnt   the   Vedas.   Those \nwho    have    mastered    the    truths    of    the \nVedanta   will   not   judge   another   on   mere \nconsiderations of age or appearance.\"  \nThe   gatekeeper   said:   \"Stop.   Have   done \nwith  your  idle  brag.  How  can  you,  a  mere  \nboy,     have     learnt     and     realised     the \nVedanta?\" \nThe  boy  said:  \"You  mean  I  am  not  big  like  \nan  over-grown  gourd  with  no  substance  in \nit?  Size  is  no  indication  of  knowledge  or \nworth,  nor  is  age.  A  very  tall  old  man  may  \nbe a tall old fool. Let me pass.\" \nThe   gatekeeper   said:   \"You   are   certainly \nnot  old,  nor  tall,  though  you  talk  like  all \nthe hoary sages. Get out.\"  \nAshtavakra    replied:    \"Gatekeeper,    Grey \nhairs  do  not  prove  the  ripeness  of  the  soul.  \nThe  really  mature  man  is  the  one  who  has  \n\nlearnt    the    Vedas    and    the    Vedangas, \nmastered    their    gist    and    realised    their \nessence.  I  am  here  to  meet  the  court  pandit  \nVandi. Inform King Janaka of my desire.\"  \nAt   that   moment   the   king   himself   came \nthere   and   easily   recognized   Ashtavakra, \nthe   precociously   wise   boy   he   had   met \nbefore. \nThe   king   asked:   \"Do   you   know   that   my \ncourt    pandit    Vandi    has    overthrown    in \nargument  many  great  scholars  in  the  past \nand  caused  them  to  be  cast  into  the  ocean?  \nDoes    that    not    deter    you    from    this \ndangerous adventure?\" \nAshtavakra       replied:       \"Your       eminent \nscholar   has   not   hitherto   encountered   men \nlike  me  who  are  proficient  in  the  Vedas  on  \nVedanta.   He   has   become   arrogant   and \nvain   with   easy   victories   over   good   men \nwho  were  not  real  scholars.  I  have  come \nhere  to  repay  the  debt  due  on  account  of \nmy  father,  who  was  defeated  by  this  man \nand   made   to   drown   himself,   as   I   have \nheard  from  my  mother.  I  have  no  doubt  I  \nshall   vanquish   Vandi,   whom   you   will   see \ncrumple   up   like   a   broken-wheeled   cart. \nPlease summon him.\" \nAshtavakra   met   Vandi.   They   took   up   a \ndebatable  thesis  and  started  an  argument, \neach   employing   his   utmost   learning   and \nwits  to  confound  the  other.  And  in  the  end  \nthe    assembly    unanimously    declared    the \nvictory   of   Ashtavakra   and   the   defeat   of \nVandi.  \nThe   court   pandit   of   Mithila   bowed   his \nhead   and   paid   the   forfeit   by   drowning \nhimself   in   the   ocean   and   going   to   the \nabode    of    Varuna.Then    the    spirit    of \nKagola,   the   father   of   Ashtavakra,   gained \npeace and joy in the glory of his son.  \nThe  author  of  the  epic  instructs  us  through \nthese   words   put   in   Kagola's   mouth:   \"A \nson  need  not  be  like  his  father.  A  father \nwho  is  physically  weak  may  have  a  very \nstrong   son   and   an   ignorant   father   may \nhave   a   scholarly   son.   It   is   wrong   to \nacesess   the   greatness   of   a   man   on   his \nphysical    appearance    or    age.    External \nappearances  are  deceptive.\"    Which  shows \nthat  the  unlearned  Kagola  was  not  devoid  \nof common sense. \n",

I  find  no  joy  in  life  in  the  \nabsence of Arjuna.\" \nThe    other    Pandavas    shared    Draupadi's \nwretchedness   at   separation   from   Arjuna, \nwho  had  gone  to  the  Himalayas  in  quest \nof divine weapons. \nBhimasena  told  Draupadi:  \"Blessed  lady,  I \nmyself   feel   the   same   about   Arjuna   and \nwhat   you   say   makes   me   thrill   with   love \nand    sympathy.    Bereft    of    Arjuna,    this \nbeautiful   forest   seems   desolate.   My   mind \ncan  know  no  peace  without  seeing  Arjuna.  \nSahadeva, how do you feel?\"  \nSahadeva   said:   \"This   hermitage   seems   to \nbe   empty   without   Arjuna.   We   shall   try \nwhether  a  change  of  scene  will  help  us  to  \nbear the pain of separation better.\" \nYudhishthira       addressing       his       priest \nDhaumya   said:   \"I   have   sent   my   younger \nbrother   Arjuna   to   win   divine   weapons. \nThat  dauntless  and  dexterous  hero  has  not  \nyet   returned.   We   have   sent   him   to   the \nHimalayas  to  get  from  Indra,  the  king  of \ngods, weapons    with    which    we    could \nconquer     Bhishma,     Drona,     Kripa     and \nAswatthama,  since  it  is  certain  that  these \nheroes  will  fight  on  the  side  of  the  sons  of  \nDhritarashtra.  Karna  knows  the  secret  of \ndivine  weapons,  and  his  supreme  wish  is \nto  fight  with  Arjuna.  I  have  sent  Arjuna  to  \ngain  Indra's  grace  and  get  weapons  from \nhim  as  the  Kaurava  heroes  can  be  defeated  \nby  no  other  means.  Having  sent  him  on  a  \nvery   difficult   errand,   we   cannot   live   here \nhappily,    for    we    miss    him    in    all    our \naccustomed     haunts.     I     wish     to     go \nelsewhere,  for  that  may  enable  us  to  bear  \n\nthe   separation   better.   Can   you   suggest \nwhere we could go?\"  \nDhaumya  described  many  forests  and  holy \nplaces.  The  Pandavas  went  the  round  of \nthose  places  to  relieve  themselves  to  some  \nextent from the pangs of separation.  \nThey   spent   many   years   in   this   pilgrimage \nand   in   listening   to   the   traditions,   which \nsanctified    each    shrine.    Draupadi    would \noften  feel  exhausted  by  having  to  traverse \nmountains   and   forests.   Bhima,   sometimes \nhelped   by   his   son   Ghalotkacha,   would \nserve  and  encourage  them  and  make  their  \nlabors easy.  \nIn  the  course  of  their  wanderings  through \nthe   Himalayan   regions   they   came   to   a \nterrible  forest  where  the  path  was  rugged \nand steep.  \nYudhishthira  was  worried  and  told  Bhima \nthat    the    way    would    greatly    distress \nDraupadi  but  that  he  himself  would  go  on \naccompanied    by    Nakula    and    the    sage \nLomasa.  \nHe   suggested   that   Bhima   and   Sahadeva \nshould   stay   behind   at   Gangadwara   with \nDraupadi.   Bhima   would   not   agree.   He \nsaid    that    the    pain    of    separation    from \nArjuna   ought   to   have   taught   his   brother \nhow   much   he   would   suffer   if   he   were \nparted    from    Sahadeva,    Draupadi    and \nBhima.  \nBesides,       Bhima       could       not       leave \nYudhishthira   alone   in   this   forest   infested \nwith      Rakshasas,      demons      and      wild \nanimals.  The  way  was  hard,  but  he  could \neasily    carry    Draupadi   across   the   most \ndifficult  parts  of  it.  He  could  carry  Nakula  \nand Sahadeva also. \nWhen       Bhima       said       these       words, \nYudhishthira   embraced   him   and   blessed \nhim    and    wished    him    an    increase    of \nphysical    strength.    Draupadi    smiled    and \nsaid,    addressing    Yudhishthira:    \"No    one \nneed   carry   me.   I   can   walk.   Do   not   be \nanxious about me.\" \nThey   reached   Kulinda,   the   kingdom   of \nSubahu,  on  the  Himalayas.  They  accepted \nthe  honors  rendered  to  them  by  that  king \nand   rested   there   awhile.   Later   on,   they \nwent      to      the      charming      forest      of \nNarayanasrama and halted there.  \nOne   day,   a   breeze   that   blew   from   the \nnortheast   wafted   a   beautiful   flower   near \nDraupadi.   Draupadi   took   it   in   her   hands \nand  was  so  charmed  with  its  fragrance  and  \nbeauty   that   she   showed   it   rapturously   to \nBhima.  \n\"Come  and  see  this  flower.  What  a  sweet  \nfragrance!   How   charming!   I   shall   hand \nthis    over    to    Yudhishthira.    Bring    some \nflowers  of  this  kind.  We  should  grow  this  \nplant   in   our   Kamyaka   forest.\"   Draupadi \nran to give the flower to Yudhishthira.  \nAnxious   to   please   his   beloved   Draupadi, \nBhima   went   in   quest   of   that   plant.   He \nwent  alone  in  the  direction  from  which  the  \nfragrance   seemed   to   be   borne   by   the \nbreeze,   without   wasting   a   thought   on   the \nwild beasts that crossed his path.  \nHe  presently  came  to  a  garden  of  plantain \ntrees  at  the  foot  of  a  mountain,  and  there  \nhe    saw    a    huge    monkey    shining    like \nblazing   fire,   which   lay   right   across   his \npath blocking it.  \nHe  tried  to  frighten  the  animal  out  of  his \nway  by  shouting  at  it.  It  only  half  opened  \nits    eyes    lazily    and    drawled:    \"I    am \nindisposed   and  so  I  am  lying  here.  Why \nlid  you  wake  me?  You  are  a  wise  human \nbeing  and  I  am  mere  animal.  It  is  proper \nthat   the   rational   man   should   show   mercy \nto    animals    as    interior    creatures.    I    am \nafraid    you    are    ignorant    of    right    and \nwrong.   Who   are   you?   Whither   are   you \nbound?   It   is   not   possible   to   go   further \nalong  this  mountain  path  which  is  the  path \nof  the  gods.  Men  cannot  cross  this  limit. \nEat  what  you  like  of  the  fruits  of  this  place  \nand if you are wise, go back in peace.\"  \nBhima,   unused   to   being   taken   so   lightly, \ngrew   angry   and   shouted:   \"Who   are   you, \n\nyourself,    you    monkey,    that    indulges    in \nsuch   tall   talk?   I   am   a   kshatriya   hero,   a \ndescendant  of  the  Kuru  race  and  a  son  of \nKunti.   Know   that   I   am   the   son   of   the \nWind  god.  Now  move  away  from  the  path  \nor stop me at your peril.\" \nHearing   these   words   the   monkey   merely \nsmiled   and   said:   \"I   am,   as   you   say,   a \nmonkey,  but  you  will  come  to  destruction \nif you try to force a way.\"  \nBhima   said:   \"I   do   not   want   your   advice \nand  it  is  no  concern  of  yours  if  I  go  to \ndestruction.  Get  up  and  move  out  of  the \nway or I will make you.\" \nThe   monkey   replied:   \"I   have   no   strength \nto  stand  up,  being  but  a  very  old  monkey.  \nIf  you  have  to  go  at  any  cost,  jump  over  \nme.\" \nBhima  said:  \"Nothing  could  be  easier  but \nthe  scriptures  forbid  it.  Otherwise  I  should  \njump over   you   and   the   mountain   in   one \nbound, like Hanuman crossing the ocean.\" \nThe    monkey    remarked    as    though    in \nsurprise:   \"O   best   of   men,   who   is   that \nHanuman  who  crossed  the  ocean?  If  you \nknow his story, enlighten me.\" \nBhima   roared   and   said:   \"Have   you   not \nheard  of  Hanuman,  my  elder  brother,  who  \ncrossed  the  ocean,  a  hundred  yojanas  in \nbreadth,  to  seek  and  find  Sita,  the  wife  of \nRama?  I  am  equal  to  him  in  strength  and \nheroism.   Well,   that   is   enough   talk,   now \nget  up  and  make  way  and  do  not  provoke  \nme to do you some harm.\"  \nThe   monkey   answered:   \"O   mighty   hero, \nbe   patient.   Be   gentle   as   you   are   strong, \nand  have  mercy  on  the  old  and  weak.  I \nhave   no   strength   to   rise   up   as   I   am \ndecrepit  with  age.  Since  you  have  scruples  \nin   jumping   over   me,   kindly   move   aside \nmy tail and make a path for yourself.\" \nProud    of    his    immense    strength,    Bhima \nthought  to  pull  the  monkey  out  of  the  way \nby  its  tail.  But,  to  his  amazement  he  could  \nnot  move  it  in  the  least,  though  he  exerted  \nall his strength.  \nHe  set  his  jaws  and  strained  every  muscle  \ntill   the   very   sinews   cracked   and   he   was \ncovered  with  perspiration.  But,  still,  could \nnot  move  that  tail  the  least,  a  little  bit  up \nor  down  or  sideways.  In  shame,  he  bent \ndown   his   head,   and   then   asked   in   a \nchastened mood:  \n\"Who  are  you?  Forgive  me  and  reveal  to \nme   whether   you   are   a   Siddha,   god   or \nGandharva.\"  Bhima  like  most  strong  men, \nwas  all  respect  when  he  saw  one  stronger  \nthan    himself,    and    spoke    like    a    pupil \naddressing his master. \nHanuman      replied:      \"O      mighty-armed \nPandava,   know   that   I   am   your   brother, \neven  that  Hanuman,  the  son  of  the  Wind \ngod,   whom   you   mentioned   a   little   while \nago.  If  you  go  on  this  path,  which  is  the \nroad  to  the  spirit-world  where  the  Yakshas  \nand   the   Rakshasas   abide,   you   will   meet \nwith  danger  and  that  is  why  I  stop  you.  No  \nman  can  go  beyond  this  and  live.  But  here  \nis   the   stream   with   its   depths   where   you \ncan  find  the  Saugandhika  plant  you  came \nto seek.\"  \nBhima   was   transported   with   delight:   \"I \ncount  myself  the  most  fortunate  of  men  in \nthat   I   have   been   blessed   to   meet   my \nbrother.  I  wish  to  see  the  form  in  which \nyou  crossed  the  ocean,\"  and  he  prostrated  \nbefore Hanuman. \nHanuman   smiled   and   began   to   increase \nthe  size  of  his  body  and  stood  forth  firmly \nto  the  world  like  a  mountain    seeming  to \nfill the landscape.  \nBhima   was   thrilled   at   actually   seeing that \ndivine  form  of  this  elder  brother,  the  mere  \ndescription   of   which   had   till   then   filled \nhim   with   wonder.   He   covered   his   eyes, \nunable  to  bear  the  dazzling  light  radiating \nfrom that figure.  \nHanuman  said:  \"Bhima,  in  the  presence  of \nmy    enemies,    my    body    can    grow    still \nmore.\"     And     Hanuman     contracted     his \nbody,    resuming    his    former    size.    He \ntenderly embraced Bhimasena.  \n\nBhagavan    Vyasa    says    that    Bhima    felt \ncompletely   refreshed   and   became   much \nstronger   than   before   by   the   embrace   of \nHanuman.  \nHanuman  said:  \"O  hero,  go  to  your  abode.  \nThink  of  me  whenever  you  are  in  need.  I  \nfelt  the  same  delight  when  I  embraced  you  \nthat  I  had  in  times  of  yore  when  I  was \nfortunate  enough  to  touch  the  divine  body \nof Sri Rama. Ask any boon that you like.\" \nBhima  said:  \"Blessed  are  the  Pandavas  for  \nI  have  had  the  good  fortune  to  see  you. \nInspired  with  your  strength  we  are  sure  to  \nconquer our enemies.\"  \nHanuman  gave  this  parting  blessing  to  his \nbrother:  \n\"While    you    roar    like    a    lion    in    the \nbattlefield,   my   voice   shall   join   yours   and \nstrike    terror    into    the    hearts    of    your \nenemies.  I  shall  be  present  on  the  flag  of \nthe   chariot   of   your   brother   Arjuna.   You \nwill be victorious.\" \nHanuman  pointed  out  to  Bhima  the  stream \nnearby,    where    grew    the    Saugandhika \nflowers he had come to seek.  \nThis    put    Bhima    at    once    in    mind    of \nDraupadi  who  was  waiting  for  his  return, \nand  he  collected  the  flowers  and  returned \nto her without delay. \n",

How strange!\" \nHearing    this    Markandeya    told    him    a \nsacred story. \nThere    was    once    a    brahmana,    named \nKausika     who     observed     his     vow     of \nbrahmacharya.    with    great    steadfastness \nand devotion.  \nOne  day,  he  sat  under  a  tree  reciting  the \nVedas.  A  crane,  perched  on  the  top  of  the  \ntree,   defiled   his   head   with   its   droppings. \nHe   looked   up   at   it,   and   his   angry   look \nkilled the bird and it fell down dead.  \nThe   brahmana   was   pained   when   he   saw \nthe dead bird lying on the ground. \nHow    frightful    it    would    be    if    wishes \nfulfilled  themselves,  if  each  hasty  or  angry \nwish  took  effect  at  once!  How  much  there  \nwould  be  to  regret  or  repent  afterwards!  It  \nis    lucky    for    us    that    wishes    depend \nonoutward              circumstances              for \naccomplishment,   since   that   saves   us   from \nmuch sin and sorrow.  \nKausika   sorrowed   that   the   evil   thought \nthat   passed   in   his   mind   in   a   moment   of \nanger   had   killed   an   innocent   bird.   Some \ntime later, he went as usual to beg alms.  \nHe  stood  before  the  door  of  a  house  to \nreceive    his    dole.    The    housewife    was \ncleansing   utensils   at   that   time.   Kausika \nwaited  in  the  hope  that  she  would  attend \nto him after her work was over.  \nIn  the  meantime  the  master  of  the  house \nreturned,   tired   and   hungry,   and   the   wife \nhad  to  attend  to  his  wants,  wash  and  dry \nhis feet and serve him with food.  \nIn  this  preoccupation  she  seemed  to  have \nforgotten   the   mendicant   waiting   outside. \nAfter  her  husband  had  been  cared  for  and  \nfed,    she    came    out    with    alms    to    the \nmendicant.  \nShe  said:  \"I  am  sorry  to  have  kept  you \nwaiting long. Pardon me.\" \nKausika,  burning  with  anger,  said:  \"Lady, \nyou  have  made  me  wait  for  such  a  long \ntime. This indifference is not fair.\"  \n\nThe   woman   told   the   brahmana:   \"Best   of \nbrahmanas,   kindly   do   forgive   me.   I   was \nserving my husband and hence the delay.\" \nThe   brahmana   remarked:   \"It   is   right   and \nproper  to  attend  on  the  husband,  but  the \nbrahmana  also  should  not  be  disregarded. \nYou seem an arrogant woman.\" \nShe   said:   \"Be   not   angry   with   me   and \nremember   that   I   kept   you   waiting   only \nbecause     I     was     dutifully     serving     my \nhusband.  I  am  no  crane  to  be  killed  by  a  \nviolent  thought  and  your  rage  can  do  no \nharm  to  the  woman  who  devotes  herself  to  \nthe service of her husband.\" \nThe    brahmana    was    taken    aback.    He \nwondered   how   the   woman   knew   of   the \ncrane incident. \nShe  continued:  \"O  great  one,  you  do  not \nknow  the  secret  of  duty,  and  you  are  also  \nnot  aware  that  anger  is  the  greatest  enemy \nthat   dwells   in   man.   Forgive   the   delay   in \nattending   to   you.   Go   to   Mithila   and   be \ninstructed   in   the   secret   of   good   life   by \nDharmavyadha living in that city.\"  \nThe   brahmana   was   amazed.   He   said:   \"I \ndeserve   your   just   admonition   and   it   will \ndo  me  good.  May  all  good  attend  you.\" \nWith these words he went to Mithila. \nKausika   reached   Mithila   and   looked   for \nDharmavyadha's     residence,     which     he \nthought   would   be   some   lonely   hermitage \nfar  from  the  noise  and  bustle  of  common \nlife.  \nHe     walked     along     magnificent     roads \nbetween   beautiful   houses   and   gardens   in \nthat    great    city    and    finally    reached    a \nbutcher's  shop,  in  which  was  a  man  selling \nmeat.  His  amazement  was  great  when  he \nlearnt that this man was Dharmavyadha. \nThe     brahmana     was     shocked     beyond \nmeasure  and  stood  at  a  distance  in  disgust.  \nThe  butcher  suddenly  rose  from  his  seat, \ncame    to    the    brahmana    and    inquired: \n\"Revered    sir,    are    you    well?    Did    that \nchaste brahmana lady send you to me?\"  \nThe brahmana was stupefied. \n\"Revered  sir,  I  know  why  you  have  come.  \nLet  us  go  home,\"  said  the  butcher  and  he \ntook  the  brahmana  to  his  house  where  he  \nsaw  a  happy  family  and  was  greatly  struck  \nby   the   devotion   with   which   the   butcher \nserved his parents.  \nKausika  took  his  lessons  from  that  butcher  \non    dharma,    man's    calling    and    duty. \nAfterwards,   the   brahmana   returned to  his \nhouse   and   began   to   tend   his   parents,   a \nduty,    which    he    had    rather    neglected \nbefore.  \nThe    moral    of    this    striking    story    of \nDharmavyadha    so    skillfully    woven    by \nVedavyasa   into   the   Mahabharata,   is   the \nsame   as   the   teaching   of   the   Gita.   Man \nreaches  perfection  by  the  honest  pursuit  of \nwhatever  calling  falls  to  his  lot  in  life,  and  \nthat   this   is   really   worship   of   God   who \ncreated  and  pervades  all.  (Bhagavad  Gita, \nXVIII, 45-46)  \nThe  occupation  may  be  one  he  is  born  to  \nin  society  or  it  may  have  been  forced  on \nhim by   circumstances   or   be   may   have \ntaken   it   up   by   choice.   But   what   really \nmatters    is    the    spirit    of    sincerity    and \nfaithfulness   with   which   be   does   his   life's \nwork. \nVedavyasa  emphasizes  this  great  truth  by \nmaking  a  scholarly  brahmana,  who  did  not  \nknow  it,  learn  it  from  a  butcher,  who  lived  \nit in his humble and despised life. \n",

And  one  such,  returning \nto  Hastinapura,  went  to  see  Dhritarashtra, \nwho received him with due honor.  \nThe  brahmana  told  him  how  the  Pandavas,  \nborn  princes,  were,  by  unkind  destiny,  at \nthe   mercy   of   the   wind   and   the   sun   and \nsuffered great privations.  \nDhritarashtra   was   probably   sorry   to   hear \nthis.  But  what  troubled  him  most  were  the  \nconsequences    to    his    own sons.   Could \n\nYudhishthira   continue   to   hold   the   justly \nwrathful Bhima in check?  \nDhritarashtra  feared  that  the  anger  of  the \nPandavas,   long   pent   up,   might   one   day \nbreak    its    bounds    and    overflow    in    a \ndevastating flood.  \nThe      king      anxiously      pondered      thus: \n\"Arjuna   and   Bhima   will   certainly   try   to \npunish    us.    Sakuni,    Karna,    Duryodhana \nand     the     short-sighted     Duhsasana     are \nperched  precariously  up  a  tree  in  search  of  \na  honeycomb  while  below  is  the  abyss  of \nBhima's  anger  yawning  to  receive  them  to \ntheir destruction.\" \nThe  blind  king  pursued  his  thought:  \"Alas, \nwhy     did     we     become     a     prey     to \ncovetousness?  It  is  not  as  though  poverty \ndrove  us  to  it!  Why  did  we  take  to  the \npath  of  injustice?  Instead  of  enjoying  our \nboundless     wealth     in     contentment     we \nsuccumbed     to     lust     of     power     and \npossession  and  coveted  what  was  not  ours.  \nWrong  cannot  but  yield  its  bitter  harvest! \nArjuna    has    returned    from    heaven    with \ndivine   weapons.   What   could   tempt   one \nback  to  earth  from  heaven  but  the  craving \nfor   vengeance?   And   we   have   earned   it!\" \nThese  thoughts  would  haunt  and  give  him \nno peace. \nThough   Dhritarashtra   was   thus   worried, \nSakuni,    Karna    and    Duryodhana    were \ngiddily  happy  and  found  much  pleasure  in \nexulting   congratulation   of   one   another   on \ntheir prosperity.  \nKarna   and   Sakuni   said   to   Duryodhana: \n\"The  kingdom  which  was  in  the  hands  of \nYudhishthira   has   become   ours.   We   need \nno longer burn with jealousy.\"  \nDuryodhana  replied:  \"O  Karna,  all  that  is \ntrue,  but  would  it  not  be  a  joy  of  joys  to  \nsee   with   my   own   eyes   the   sufferings   of \nthe  Pandavas  and  bring  their  sorrow  to  a  \nclimax  by  a  display  of  our  happiness?  The  \nonly  way  to  perfect  our  happiness  is  to  go  \nto  the  forest  and  see  the  distress  of  the \nPandavas,    but    my    father    will    refuse \npermission,\"   and   Duryodhana   shed   tears \nat   his   father's   cruelty   in   denying   him   this \npleasure. \nHe    said    again:    \"The    king    fears    the \nPandavas,    as    he    thinks    that    they    are \nendowed  with  the  power  of  austerities.  He  \nforbids   us   to   go   to   the   forest   and   meet \nthem,   lest   danger   should   befall   us.   But   I \ntell  you,  all  we  have  done  so  far  is  labor  \nlost,   without   a   sight   of   the   sufferings   of \nDraupadi,  Bhima  and  Arjuna  in  the  forest.  \nThis   life   of   idle   ease   is   torment   to   me \nwithout  that  great  joy.  Sakuni  and  yourself \nmust   seek   a   way   of   obtaining   the   king's \nconsent  for  us  to  go  to  the  forest  and  see  \nthe Pandavas in their misery.\" \nEarly    next    morning,    Karna    went    to \nDuryodhana    with    a    cheerful    face    and \nannounced  that  he  had  found  a  way  out  of  \nthe difficulty.  \nHe  said:  \"What  do  you  think  of  going  to \nour  ranches  at  Dwaitavana  for  the  annual \nstock-taking    of    the    cows?    The    king \ncertainly   cannot   object   to   that.\"   Sakuni \nand    Duryodhana    applauded    this    bright \nidea  and  sent  the  leader  of  the  cowherds  to  \nthe king to secure his permission. \nBut   the   king   would   not   assent.   He   said: \n\"Hunting     is     indeed     beneficial     to     the \nprinces.  It  is  also  desirable  to  take  stock  of  \nthe  cows.  But  I  learn  that  the  Pandavas  are  \ndwelling  in  that  forest.  It  is  not  advisable \nfor  you  to  go  there.  I  cannot  agree  to  send  \nyou  to  a  place  near  the  abode  of  Bhima \nand  Arjuna  while  there  is  still  occasion  for  \nanger and strife.\"  \nDuryodhana   said:   \"We   shall   not   go   near \nthem.   On   the   contrary   we   shall   be   very \ncareful     and     avoid     them.\"     The     king \nanswered: \n\"However   careful   you   may   be,   there   is \ndanger   in   mere   nearness.   Also,   it   is   not \nright   to   intrude   on   the   sorrows   of   the \nPandavas   in   their   forest   life.   Anyone   of \nyour    soldiers    might    trespass    and    give \noffence,    which    may    lead    to    trouble. \n\nSomeone   else   can   go   in   your   stead   to \ncount the cattle.\"  \nSakuni  said:  \"O  king,  Yudhishthira  knows \nand  follows  the  path  of  dharma.  He  has \ngiven   his   promise   in   the   open   assembly \nand  the  Pandavas  will  follow  his  bidding. \nThe   sons   of   Kunti   will   not   show   any \nenmity    towards    us.    Do    not    oppose \nDuryodhana   who   is   fond   of   hunting.   Let \nhim  return  after  taking  stock  of  the  cows.  I  \nshall   also   accompany   him   and   see   to   it \nthat   none   of   us   go   anywhere   near   the \nPandavas.\" \nThe   king,   over-persuaded   as   usual,   said: \n\"Well,   please   yourselves.\"   A   heart   full   of \nhate  can  know  no  contentment.

They  inspected  the  herds  \nof cows and took stock of them.  \nAfter  counting  the  cows,  bulls  and  calves, \nthey   enjoyed   the   dance,   the   hunt,   the \nsylvan    sports    and    other    entertainment’s \narranged for them. \nWhile   hunting,   Duryodhana   and   his   party \nreached    an    attractive    pond    near    the \nhermitage  of  the  Pandavas  and  ordered  a \ncamp to be put on its bank.  \nChitrasena,   the   king   of   the   Gandharvas, \nand  his  attendants  had  already  encamped \nin  the  neighborhood  of  the  pool  and  they \nprevented   Duryodhana's   men   from   putting \nup their camp.  \nThey     returned     to     Duryodhana     and \nrepresented   that   some   petty   prince   who \nwas   there   with   his   followers   was   giving \nthem trouble. \nDuryodhana      was      annoyed      at      this \npresumption  and  directed  his  men  to turn \nthe  Gandharva  prince  out  and  put  up  the \ntents.  The  attendants  returned  to  the  lake \nand   tried   to   carry   out   their   orders   but \nfound  the  Gandharvas  too  many  for  them \nand had to retreat in precipitation. \nWhen  Duryodhana  came  to  know  of  this, \nhe  grew  very  angry  and  with  a  large  army  \nmarched  to  destroy  the  audacious  enemies  \nwho  had  dared  to  resist  his  pleasure.  A \ngreat       fight       ensued       between       the \nGandharvas and Duryodhana's army.  \nAt   first   the   fight   went   in   favor   of   the \nKauravas.   But   the   tables   were   quickly \nturned   when   Chitrasena,   the   king   of   the \nGandharvas,   rallied   his   troops   and   began \nusing his magic weapons.  \nKarna  and  the  other  Kaurava  heroes  lost \ntheir   chariots   and   weapons   and   had   to \nretreat       in       haste       and       ignominy. \nDuryodhana     alone     remained     in     the \nbattlefield   but   he   was   soon   seized   by \nChitrasena,  who  placed  him  in  his  chariot \nbound  hand  and  foot,  and  blew  his  conch \nin token of victory.  \nThe     Gandharvas     took     many     of     the \nprominent  Kauravas  captive.  The  Kaurava \narmy  fled  in  all  directions  and  some  of  the  \nfugitives   took   refuge   in   the   hermitage   of \nthe Pandavas. \nBhima   heard   the   news   of   Duryodhana's \ndefeat    and    capture    with    delight    and \namusement.     He     said     to     Yudhishthira: \n\"These  Gandharvas  have  done  our  job  for  \nus.   Duryodhana,   who   must   have   come \nhere   to   mock   at   us,   has   got   what   he \ndeserved.     I     feel     like     thanking     our \nGandharva friend!\"  \nBut    Yudhishthira    reproved    him:    \"Dear \nbrother,   this   is   not   the   time   for   you   to \nrejoice.  The  Kauravas  are  our  kith  and  kin  \nand    their    humiliation,    at    the    hands    of \nstrangers,   is   ours.   We   cannot hold  back \nand  take  this  lying  down.  We  must  rescue  \nthem.\" \n\nBhima  did  not  think  this  very  reasonable. \nHe  said:  \"Why  should  we  save  this  sinner  \nwho   tried   to   burn   us   alive   in   the   wax \nhouse?  Why  should  you  feel  sorry  for  the  \nfellow  who  poisoned  my  food,  bound  me \nhand  and  foot  and  wanted  to  drown  me  in  \nthe   river?   What   brotherly   feeling   can   we \nreally   have   towards   these   vile   wretches \nwho    hauled    Draupadi    by    the    hair    to \ntheassembly and disgraced her?\"  \nAt   that   moment   a   cry   of   agony   from \nDuryodhana  reached  them  faintly  from  the  \ndistance   and   Yudhishthira,   greatly   moved, \noverruled  Bhima's  objection  and  bade  his \nbrothers go to the rescue of the Kauravas.  \nObedient  to  his  behest,  Bhima  and  Arjuna  \nrallied    the    routed    Kaurava    forces    and \noffered    battle    to    the    Gandharvas.    But \nChitrasena   had   no   wish   to   fight   with   the \nPandavas  and  at  their  approach,  released \nDuryodhana     and     the     other     prisoners \nsaying  that  all  he  wanted  was  to  teach  a \nlesson to these arrogant Kauravas.  \nThe    dishonored    Kauravas    returned    in \nhaste   to   Hastinapura,   with Karna,   who, \nhaving    been,    driven    off    the    battlefield, \njoined them on the way. \nDuryodhana,      in      great      shame      and \ndejection,   felt   it   would   have   been   far \nbetter  if  be  had  been  killed  by  Chitrasena  \nand announced his wish to fast unto death.  \nHe  said  to  Duhsasana: \"Be  crowned  and \nrule  the  kingdom.  I  can  no  longer  continue  \nto   live   after   having   become   a   laughing \nstock to my enemies.\" \nDuhsasana   protested   his   unworthiness   to \nbe  king  and  caught  hold  of  his  brother's \nfeet  and  wept.  Karna  could  not  bear  the \nsight of the brother's sorrow. \nKarna  said:  \"This  does  not  befit  heroes  of \nthe   Kuru   race.   What   is   the   use   of   just \ncollapsing  under  sorrow?  It  will  but  make \nyour     enemies     happy.     Look     at     the \nPandavas.  They  have  not  taken  to  fasts  in \nspite of the disgrace they have suffered.\"  \nSakuni    interposed    and    said:    \"Listen    to \nKarna's  words.  Why  do  you  say  that  you \nwould  give  up  your  life  when  the  kingdom \nseized   from   the   Pandavas   is   yours   to \nenjoy?   Fasting   serves   no   purpose,   for   if \nyou  really  repent  of  what  you  have  done \ntill  now,  you  should  make  friends  with  the  \nPandavas    and    give    them    back    their \nkingdom.\"  \nWhen   Duryodhana   heard   this   speech,   his \nevil     nature     regained     ascendancy,     for \ngiving  back  the  kingdom  to  the  Pandavas \nwas   to   him   a   hundred   times   worse   than \ndefeat   or   disgrace.   He   shouted:   \"I   shall \nconquer the Pandavas.\" \nKarna  said:  \"That  is  the  way  for  a  king  to  \ntalk.\" \nAnd   he   added:   \"What   sense   is   there   in \ndying?  You  can  do  something  worthwhile \nonly if you are alive.\"  \nWhile    returning    home,    Karna    said:    \"I \nswear  to  you  by  all  that  is  holy  that, when \nthe   stipulated   period   of   thirteen   years   is \nover,   I   will   kill   Arjuna   in   battle.\"   And \nthen  he  touched  his  sword  in  token  of  the  \noath. \n",

      "content": "\nWHILE   the   Pandavas   were   dwelling   in \nthe  forest,  Duryodhana  celebrated  a  great \nsacrifice with much pomp and splendor.  \nHe    wanted    to    perform    the    Rajasuya \nsacrifice,  but  the  brahmanas  told  him  that \nhe   could   not   do   that   while   Yudhishthira \nand   Dhritarashtra   were   alive   and   advised \nhim  to  perform  the  sacrifice  known  as  the  \nVaishnava instead. \nHe  accepted  this  advice  and  celebrated  the  \nVaishnava   with   great   splendor.   But   when \nthe  ceremony  was  over,  the  citizens  began \nto       talk       among       themselves       that \nDuryodhana's  sacrifice  had  not  come  up  to  \neven   a   sixteenth   part   of   Yudhishthira's \nRajasuya in magnificence.  \nThe   friends   of   Duryodhana,   on   the   other \nhand,  praised  him  and  the  sacrifice  he  had  \ncelebrated     and     likened     it     to     those \n\nperformed   by   Yayati,   Mandhata,   Bharata \nand others.  \nCourt    flatterers    were    not    sparing    with \ntheir   praise.   Karna   told   Duryodhana   that \nhis  Rajasuya  had  been  only  postponed  till \nthe  Pandavas  should  be  defeated  and  slain \nin  battle  and  repeated  that  his  part  would \nbe the slaying of Arjuna.  \n\"Till  I  have  slain  Arjuna,\"  said  he,  \"I  shall \nnot  take  meat  or  wine,  nor  will  I  refuse  the  \nprayer    of    anyone who    asks    me    for \nanything.\"    Such    was    the    solemn    vow \ntaken by Karna in the assembly. \nThe   sons   of   Dhritarashtra   were   delighted \nto  hear  this  vow  of  the  great  hero  Karna \nand   shouted   in   joy.   They   felt   as   if   the \nPandavas had been slain already. \nSpies   conveyed   to the   Pandavas   in   the \nforest   the   news   of   the   oath   taken   by \nKarna.        Yudhishthira        was        greatly \nconcerned,  for  he  had  a  great  opinion  of \nKarna's prowess.  \nKarna   had   been   born   with   divine   armor \nand  was  undoubtedly  a  mighty  hero.  One \nmorning,     just     before     the     hour     of \nawakening, Yudhishthira had a dream.  \nMany   of   our   dreams   come   either   in   the \nbeginning  or  at  the  end  of  our  sleep.  He \ndreamt  that  the  wild  beasts  of  the  forest \ncame  and  appealed  to  him  piteously  not  to  \ndestroy  them  altogether,  but  to  move  on  to  \nsome other forest.  \nDuryodhana   felt   sure   that   the   Pandavas, \nwho  themselves  lived  from  hand  to  mouth \nin  the  forest,  would  be  unable  to  feed  or \nentertain   the   sage   and   his   following,   and \nwould  incur  some  dreadful  curse  from  that  \ntoo    hasty    visitor    for    their    want    of \nhospitality.   This   would   give   him   greater \njoy  than  any  benefit  he  could  have  asked \nfor  himself  when  the  sage  offered  a  boon.  \nDurvasa   went   with   his   disciples   to   the \nPandavas  as  was  desired  by  Duryodhana, \nas    the    latter    were    resting    after    their \nmidday meal. \nThe   brothers  welcomed  the  sage,  saluted \nand  honored  him.  Then  the  sage  said:  \"We  \nshall   be   back   soon.   Our   meals   must   be \nready    then,    for    we    are    hungry,\"    and \nhurried off with his disciples to the river.  \nAs     a     result     of     the     austerities     of \nYudhishthira  at  the  beginning  of  their  stay \nin  the  forest,  the  Sun  god  had  given  him \nthe  Akshayapatra,  a  wonderful  vessel  that \nheld a never-failing supply of food.  \nIn   making   the   gift,   the   god   had   said, \n\"Through    this    I    shall    place    at    your \ndisposal  for  twelve  years  as  much  food  as  \nis required for your daily consumption.  \nNot   till   everyone   has   been   served   and \nDraupadi  herself  has  taken  her  share  will \nthe vessel become empty for the day.\" \nAccordingly,    the    brahmanas    and    other \nguests   would   be   served   first.   Afterwards \nthe   Pandava   brothers would   take   their \nmeals.   Finally,   Draupadi   would   have   her \nshare.  \nWhen   Durvasa   reached   the   place,   all   of \nthem,   including   Draupadi,   had   eaten   their \nmeals   and   so   the   vessel   was   empty   and \ndenuded of its power for the day.  \nDraupadi     was     greatly     troubled     and \nperfectly  at  a  loss  to  find  food  when  the \nsage   and   his   disciples   should   return   after \ntheir  ablutions.  In  the  kitchen,  she  prayed \nearnestly  to  Sri  Krishna  to  come  to  her  aid  \nin   this   hopeless   predicament   and   deliver \nher from the wrath of the sage. \nAt  once  Sri  Krishna  appeared  before  her.  \n\"I    am    very    hungry,\"    he    said,    \"bring \nwithout   delay   something   to   eat   and   we \nshall speak of other things afterwards.\"  \nHere   was   a   pretty   pass.   It   looked   as \nthough  the  ally  from  whom  she  hoped  for  \nrelief  had  gone  over  to  the  foe!  She  cried  \nout  in  great  confusion:  \"Alas!  Why  do  you \ntry  me  thus,  O  Krishna?  The  power  of  the  \nvessel  given  by  the  Sun  is  exhausted  for \nthe  day.  And  the  sage  Durvasa  has  come.  \nWhat    shall    I    do?    The    sage    and    his \ndisciples  will  soon  be  here  and  as  though \n\nthis  were  not  enough,  you  have  also  come  \nat    this    juncture    saying    that    you    are \nhungry.\" \nSri   Krishna   said:   \"I   am   terribly   hungry \nand   want   food,   not   excuses.   Fetch   the \nvessel    and    let    me    see    for    myself.\" \nDraupadi  brought  it  to  him.  A  tiny  bit  of \ncooked  vegetable  and  a  grain  of  rice  were  \nsticking to the rim of the vessel.  \nSri    Krishna    ate    them    with    satisfaction, \naccepting  them  as  Sri  Hari,  the  Soul  of  the  \nUniverse.  Draupadi  was  filled  with  shame \nat   her   slovenliness   in   not   having   cleaned \nthe  vessel  free  of  all  remnants. A  bit  had  \nbeen   left   which   had   been   partaken   by \nVasudeva!  \nSri      Krishna      seemed      replete      with \nsatisfaction   after   eating   his   solitary   grain \nand  calling  Bhima,  told  him  to  go  to  the \nriver  and  intimate  to  the  revered  sage  that  \nfood was ready and waiting for them. \nBhimasena,    greatly    puzzled,    but    full    of \nfaith  in  Sri  Krishna,  hastened  to  the  river \nwhere   Durvasa   and   his   followers   were \nbathing.  \nThey   were   in   great   surprise   to   find   that \ntheir  ravenous  hunger  had  given  place  to  a  \npleased     satiety.     They     had     all     the \ncomfortable   cheerfulness   of   people   who \nhad feasted well.  \nThe   disciples   told   the   sage:   \"We   have \ncome   here   after   asking   Yudhishthira   to \nprepare  food  for  us,  but  we  feel  well-fed \nand full and cannot eat anything more.\"  \nDurvasa   knew   what   it   was   and   he   told \nBhima: \"We   have   taken   our   meals.   Tell \nYudhishthira    to    forgive    us.\"    Then    the \nparty went away.  \nThe    explanation    is    that    as    the    whole \nuniverse   is   contained   in   Sri   Krishna,   his \nsatisfaction    with    a    single    grain    of    rice \nsatisfied   for   the   time   the   hunger   of   all \nbeings including the sage. \n",

      "content": "\nTHE  stipulated  period  of  twelve  years  was  \ndrawing to a close.  \nOne  day,  a  deer  was  rubbing  itself  against  \na    poor    brahmana's    fire-kindling    mortar \nand   as   it   turned   to   go,   the   mortar   got \nentangled   in   its   horns   and   the   affrighted \nanimal fled wildly with it into the forest.  \nIn  those  days  matches  were  unknown  and  \nfire  was  kindled  with  pieces  of  wood  by \nmechanical friction.  \n\"Alas!  The  deer  is  running  away  with  my \nfire-kindler.   How   can   I   perform   the   fire \nsacrifice?\"    shouted    the    brahmana    and \nrushed  towards  the  Pandavas  for  help  in \nhis extremity.  \nThe   Pandavas   pursued   the   animal   but   it \nwas   a   magic   deer,   which   sped   in   great \nleaps  and  bounds,  decoying  the  Pandavas \nfar   into   the   forest   and   then   disappeared. \nWorn    out    by    the    futile    chase,    the \nPandavas   sat   in   great   dejection   under   a \nbanyan tree.  \nNakula   sighed:   \"We   cannot   render   even \nthis  trifling  service  to  the  brahmana.  How \nwe have degenerated!\" said he sadly.  \nBhima   said:   \"Quite   so.   When   Draupadi \nwas  dragged  into  the  assembly,  we  should  \nhave    killed    those    wretches.    Is    it    not \nbecause  we  did  not  do  so  that  we  have  had  \nto  suffer  all  these  sorrows?\"  and  he  looked  \nat Arjuna sadly.  \nArjuna    agreed.    \"I    bore    in    silence    the \nvulgar  and  insulting  brag  of  that  son  of  the  \ncharioteer,    doing    nothing.   So   we   have \ndeservedly fallen into this pitiable state.\" \nYudhishthira   noticed   with   sorrow   that   all \nof   them   had   lost   their   cheerfulness   and \ncourage.  He  thought  they  would  be  more \ncheerful   with   something   to   do.   He   was \ntormented   with   thirst   and   so   he   said to \nNakula:  \"Brother,  climb  that  tree  and  see \nwhether there is any pool or river nearby.\" \nNakula   climbed   the   tree,   looked   around \nand  said:  \"At  a  little  distance  I  see  water \nplants  and  cranes.  There  must  certainly  be  \nwater there.\" \nYudhishthira   sent   him   to   fetch   some   to \ndrink.  \n\nNakula  was  glad  when  he  got  to  the  place  \nand  saw  there  was  a  pool.  He  was  very \nthirsty     himself     and     so     thought     of \nquenching    his    thirst    first    before    taking \nwater  in  his  quiver  for  his  brother.  But  no  \nsooner    did    he    dip    his    hand    in    the \ntransparent  water  than  he  heard  a  voice, \nwhich said: \n\"Do  not  be  rash.  This  pool  belongs  to  me.  \nO  son  of  Madri,  answer  my  questions  and  \nthen drink the water.\"  \nNakula  was  surprised,  but  carried  away  by  \nhis    intense    thirst    and    heedless    of    the \nwarning,   he   drank   the   water.   At   once, \novercome   by   irresistible   drowsiness,   he \nfell down, to all appearance dead. \nSurprised   that   Nakula   had   not   returned, \nYudhishthira   sent   Sahadeva   to   see   what \nthe  matter  was.    When  Sahadeva  reached  \nthe  pool  and  saw  his  brother  lying  on  the  \nground,   he   wondered   whether   any   harm \nhad  come  to  him.  But  before  looking  into  \nthe   matter   further,   rushed   irresistibly   to \nthe water to quench his burning thirst.  \nThe  voice  was  heard  again:  \"O  Sahadeva,  \nthis  is  my  pool.  Answer  my  questions  and  \nthen only may you quench your thirst.\" \nLike  Nakula,  Sahadeva  also  did  not  heed \nthe   warning.   He   drank   the   water   and   at \nonce dropped down. \nPuzzled   and   worried   that   Sahadeva   also \ndid  not  return,  Yudhishthira  sent  Arjuna  to  \nsee  whether  the  brothers  had  met  with  any  \ndanger.  \"And  bring  water,\"  he  added,  for \nhe was very thirsty. \nArjuna   went   swiftly.   He   saw   both   his \nbrothers  lying  dead  near  the  pool.  He  was  \nshocked   at   the   sight   and   felt   that   they \nmust   have   been   killed   by   some   lurking \nfoe.  \nThough     heart-broken     with     grief     and \nburning   with   the   desire   for   revenge,   he \nfelt  all  feelings  submerged  in  a  monstrous \nthirst,   which   irresistibly   impelled   him   to \nthe  fatal  pool.  Again,  a  voice  was  heard: \n\"Answer  my  question  before  you  drink  the  \nwater.  This  pool  is  mine.  If  you  disobey \nme, you will follow your brothers.\" \nArjuna's  anger  knew  no  bounds.  He  cried: \n\"Who  are  you?  Come  and  stand  up  to  me,  \nand   I   will   kill   you,\"   and   he   shot   keen-\nedged  arrows  in  the  direction  of  the  voice.  \nThe    invisible    being    laughed    in    scorn: \n\"Your    arrows    do    but    wound    the    air. \nAnswer   my   questions   and   then   you   can \nsatisfy  your  thirst.  If  you  drink  the  water \nwithout doing so, you will die.\"  \nGreatly  vexed,  Arjuna  made  up  his  mind \nto  seek  out  and  grapple  with  this  elusive \nfoe.  But  first  he  had  to  quench  his  terrible  \nthirst.  Yes,  thirst  was  the  enemy  he  must \nkill  first.  So  he  drank  the  water  and  also \nfell down dead.  \nAfter   anxious   waiting   Yudhishthira   turned \nto  Bhima:  \"Dear  brother,  Arjuna,  the  great  \nhero,  has  also  not  yet  returned.  Something \nterrible    must    have    happened    to    our \nbrothers,  for  our  stars  are  bad.  Please  seek  \nthem  out  and  be  quick  about  it.  Also  bring  \nwater,  for  I  die  of  thirst.\"  Bhima,  racked \nwith    anxiety,    hurried    away    without    a \nword.  \nHis  grief  and  rage  can  be  imagined  when \nhe  saw  his  three  brothers  lying  there  dead. \nHe  thought:  \"This  is  certainly  the  work  of \nthe  Yakshas.  I  will  hunt  them  down  and \nkill  them.  But  O!  I  am  so  thirsty,  I  shall \nfirst  drink  water  the  better  to  fight  them.\" \nAnd then he descended into the pool. \nThe   voice   shouted:   \"Bhimasena,   beware. \nYou   may   drink   only   after   answering   my \nquestions.   You   will   die   if   you   disregard \nmy words.\" \n\"Who   are   you   to   dictate   to   me?\"   cried \nBhima,   and   he   drank   the   water   avidly, \nglaring  around  in  defiance.  And  as  he  did \nso,  his  great  strength  seemed  to  slip  from \nhim  like  a  garment.  And  he  also  fell  dead  \namong his brothers. \nAlone,   Yudhishthira   wailed   full   of   anxiety \nand  thirst.  \"Have  they  been  subjected  to  a  \ncurse  or  are  they  wandering  about  in  the \n\nforest  in  a  vain  search  for  water  or  have \nthey fainted or died of thirst?\"  \nUnable  to  bear  these  thoughts    and  driven \ndesperate   by   an   overpowering   thirst,   he \nstarted  out  to  look  for  his  brothers  and  the  \npool.  \nYudhishthira    proceeded    in    the    direction \nhis    brothers    had    taken    through    tracts \ninfested  with  wild  boar  and  abounding  in \nspotted dear    and    huge    forest    birds. \nPresently  he  came  upon  a  beautiful  green \nmeadow,  girdling  a  pool  of  pellucid  water,  \nnectar to his eyes.  \nBut  when  he  saw  his  brothers  lying  there \nlike    sacred    flagpoles    thrown    pell-mell \nafter  a  festival,  unable  to  restrain  his  grief, \nhe  lifted  his  voice  and  wept.  He  stroked \nthe  faces  of  Bhima  and  Arjuna  as  they  lay \nso still and silent there and mourned:  \n\"Was  this  to  be  the  end  of  all  our  vows?  \nJust  when  our  exile  is  about  to  end,  you \nhave  been  snatched  away.  Even  the  gods \nhave forsaken me in my misfortune!\" \nAs  he  looked  at  their  mighty  limbs,  now \nso  helpless,  he  sadly  wondered  who  could  \nhave   been   powerful   enough   to   kill   them. \nBrokenly,   he   reflected:   \"Surely   my   heart \nmust  be  made  of  steel  not  to  break  even \nafter   seeing   Nakula   and   Sahadeva   dead. \nFor  what  purpose  should  I  continue  to  live  \nin this world?\"  \nThen   a   sense   of   mystery   overcame   him, \nfor  this  could  be  no  ordinary  occurrence. \nThe   world   held   no   warriors   who   could \novercome    his    brothers.    Besides,    there \nwere   no   wounds   on   their   bodies   which \ncould  have  let  out  life  and  their  faces  were  \nfaces  of  men  who  slept  in  peace  and  not  of  \nthose who died in wrath.  \nThere  was  also  no  trace  of  the  footprints \nof   an   enemy.   There   was   surely   some \nmagic   about   it.   Or,   could   it   be   a   trick \nplayed    by    Duryodhana?    Might    he    not \nhave      poisoned      the      water?      Then \nYudhishthira  also  descended  into  the  pool,  \nin   his   turn   drawn   to   the   water   by   a \nconsuming thirst.  \nAt  once  the  voice  without  form  warned  as  \nbefore:  \"Your  brothers  died  because  they \ndid   not   heed   my   words.   Do not   follow \nthem.  Answer  my  questions  first  and  then \nquench your thirst. This pool is mine.\" \nYudhishthira   knew   that   these   could   be \nnone   other   than   the   words   of   a   Yaksha \nand   guessed   what   had   happened   to   his \nbrothers.    He    saw    a    possible    way    of \nredeeming the situation. \nHe  said  to  the  bodiless  voice:  \"Please  ask  \nyour   questions.\"   The   voice   put   questions \nrapidly one after another. \nThe    Yaksha    asked:    \"What    makes    sun \nshine every day?\"  \nYudhishthira     replied:     \"The     power     of \nBrahman.\"  \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"What  rescues  man in \ndanger?\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"Courage    is    man's \nsalvation in danger.\" \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"By  the  study  of  which  \nscience does man become wise?\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"Not    by    studying \nany  sastra  does  man  become  wise.  It  is  by  \nassociation   with   the   great   in  wisdom  that \nhe gets wisdom.\" \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"What  is  more  nobly \nsustaining than the earth?\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"The    mother    who \nbrings   up   the   children   she   has   borne   is \nnobler    and    more    sustaining    than    the \nearth.\" \nThe   Yaksha   asked:   \"What   is   higher   than \nthe sky?\" \nYudhishthira replied: \"The father.\" \nThe   Yaksha   asked:   \"What   is   fleeter   than \nwind?\" \nYudhishthira replied: \"Mind.\" \nThe     Yaksha     asked:     \"What     is     more \nblighted than withered straw?\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"A    sorrow-stricken \nheart.\" \n\nThe   Yaksha   asked:   \"What   befriends   a \ntraveller?\" \nYudhishthira replied: \"Learning.\" \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"Who  is  the  friend  of \none who stays at home?\" \nYudhishthira replied: \"The wife.\" \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"Who  accompanies  a \nman in death?\" \nYudhishthira      replied:      \"Dharma.      That \nalone   accompanies  the  soul  in  its  solitary \njourney after death.\" \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"Which  is  the  biggest \nvessel?\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"The    earth,    which \ncontains   all   within   itself   is   the   greatest \nvessel.\" \nThe Yaksha asked: \"What is happiness?\" \nYudhishthira    replied:    \"Happiness    is    the \nresult of good conduct.\" \nThe     Yaksha     asked:     \"What     is     that, \nabandoning  which  man  becomes  loved  by \nall?\" \nYudhishthira        replied:        \"Pride,        for \nabandoning that man will be loved by all.\" \nThe   Yaksha   asked:   \"What   is   the   loss \nwhich yields joy and not sorrow?\" \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"Anger,   giving   it   up, \nwe will no longer subject to sorrow.\" \nThe   Yaksha   asked:   \"What   is   that,   by \ngiving up which, man becomes rich?\" \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"Desire,   getting   rid \nof it, man becomes wealthy.\" \nThe   Yaksha   asked:   \"What   makes   one   a \nreal  brahmana?  Is  it  birth,  good  conduct  or  \nlearning? Answer decisively.\" \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"Birth   and   learning \ndo   not   make   one   a   brahmana.   Good \nconduct   alone   does.   However   learned   a \nperson  may  be  he  will  not  be  a  brahmana  \nif  he  is  a  slave  to  bad  habits.  Even  though  \nhe  may  be  learned  in  the  four  Vedas,  a \nman of bad conduct falls to a lower class.\" \nThe  Yaksha  asked:  \"What  is  the  greatest \nwonder in the world?\" \nYudhishthira  replied:  \"Every  day,  men  see \ncreatures  depart  to  Yama's  abode  and  yet,  \nthose   who   remain   seek   to   live   forever. \nThis verily is the greatest wonder.\" \nThus,   the   Yaksha   posed   many   questions \nand Yudhishthira answered them all. \nIn  the  end  the  Yaksha  asked:  \"O  king,  one  \nof  your  dead  brothers  can  now  be  revived.  \nWhom   do   you   want   revived?   He   shall \ncome back to life.\" \nYudhishthira   thought   for   a   moment   and \nthen       replied:       \"May       the       cloud-\ncomplexioned,    lotus-eyed,    broad-chested \nand  long-armed  Nakula,  lying  like  a  fallen \nebony tree, arise.\"  \nThe  Yaksha  was  pleased  at  this  and  asked  \nYudhishthira:     \"Why     did     you     choose \nNakula   in   preference   to   Bhima   who   has \nthe       strength       of       sixteen       thousand \nelephants?   I   have   heard   that   Bhima   is \nmost  dear  to  you.  And  why  not  Arjuna, \nwhose  prowess  in  arms  is  your  protection?  \nTell  me  why  you  chose  Nakula  rather  than \neither of these two.\"  \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"O   Yaksha,   dharma \nis  the  only  shield  of  man  and  not  Bhima  or  \nArjuna.   If   dharma   is   set   at   naught,   man \nwill  be  ruined.  Kunti  and  Madri  were  the \ntwo  wives  of  my  father.  I  am  surviving,  a  \nson  of  Kunti,  and  so,  she  is  not  completely  \nbereaved.   In   order   that   the   scales   of \njustice  may  be  even,  I  ask  that  Madri's  son  \nNakula   may   revive.\"   The   Yaksha   was \npleased     with     Yudhishthira's     impartiality \nand   granted   that   all   his   brothers   would \ncome back to life. \nIt  was  Yama,  the  Lord  of  Death,  who  had  \ntaken  the  form  of  the  deer  and  the  Yaksha  \nso  that  he  might  see  his  son  Yudhishthira \nand   test   him.   He   embraced   Yudhishthira \nand blessed him. \nYama   said:   \"Only   a   few   days   remain   to \ncomplete   the   stipulated   period   of   your \nexile  in  the  forest.  The  thirteenth  year  will \nalso  pass  by.  None  of  your  enemies  will \nbe    able    to    discover    you.    You    will \nsuccessfully   fulfil   your   undertaking,\"   and \nsaying this he disappeared.  \n\nThe   Pandavas   had,   no   doubt,   to   pass \nthrough   all   sorts   of   troubles   during   their \nexile,     but     the     gains     too     were     not \ninconsiderable.   It   was   a   period   of   hard \ndiscipline       and       searching       probation \nthrough  which  they  emerged  stronger  and \nnobler men.  \nArjuna   returned   from   tapas   with   divine \nweapons  and  strengthened  by  contact  with \nIndra.   Bhima   also   met   his   elder   brother \nHanuman     near     the     lake     where     the \nSaugandhika    flowers    bloomed    and    got \ntenfold  strength  from  his  embrace.  Having \nmet,   at   the   enchanted   pool,   his   father \nYama,  the  Lord  of  Dharma,  Yudhishthira \nshone with tenfold lustre.  \n\"The   minds   of   those   who   listen   to   the \nsacred    story    of    Yudhishthira's    meeting \nwith   his   father,   will   never   go   after   evil. \nThey   will   never   seek   to   create   quarrels \namong   friends   or   covet   the   wealth   of \nothers.  They  will  never  fall  victims  to  lust.  \nThey   will   never   be   unduly   attached   to \ntransitory          things.\"          Thus          said \nVaisampayana  to  Janamejaya  as  he  related  \nthis   story   of   the   Yaksha.   May   the   same \ngood   attend   the   readers   of   this   story   as \nretold by us. \n",

Still   we   have   passed   these \nyears  cheerfully  with  joy  in  the  forest.  The  \nthirteenth  year  of  exile  has  come,  and  with \nit  the  time  for  us  to  part  from  you.  For  we  \nhave   to   spend   the   next   twelve   months \nundiscovered  by  the  spies  of  Duryodhana. \nGod  knows  when  the  day  will  dawn  which  \nwill  see  us  together  again,  without  fear  or \nconcealment.  Now,  bless  us  before  we  go.  \nAnd  may  we  escape  the  notice  of  those \nwho  may  wish  to  betray  us  to  the  sons  of \nDhritarashtra,   either   through   fear   or   hope \nof reward.\"  \nSo   spoke   Yudhishthira   to   the   brahmanas \nwho   were   living   with   the   Pandavas   till \nthen.  His  voice  shook  with  emotion  as  he  \nspoke these words. \nDhaumya  consoled  him.  He  said:  \"Parting, \nis   hard,   and   the   dangers   are   many   and \ngreat.  But  you  are  too  wise  and  learned  to  \nbe  shaken  or  daunted.  You  must  disguise \nyourselves.  Indra,  the  Lord  of  gods,  when \npested   by   the   demons,   disguised   himself \nas  a  brahmana  and  lived  unknown  in  the \ncountry    of    Nishadha.    Safely    concealed \nthus,  he  managed  to  destroy  his  enemies. \nYou    must    also    do    likewise.    Did    not \nMahavishnu,   the   Lord   of   the   Universe, \nbecome   a   child   in   the   womb   of   Aditi, \nsuffer   human   birth,   and   take   away   from \nEmperor     Bali     his     kingdom     for     the \nsalvation   of   the   world?   Did   not   Lord \nNarayana,   the   refuge   of   men,   enter   into \nthe  weapon  of  Indra  to  defeat  Vritra,  the \nasura   king?   Did   not   the   Fire   god   hide \nhimself  in  the  waters  for  the  sake  of  the \ngods?   Does   not   the   moon   keep   out   of \nsight  every  day?  Did  not  Lord  Vishnu,  the  \nall-pervading  God,  descend  as  the  son  of \nDasaratha  and  spend  long  years,  suffering \nmany    sorrows    for    the    sake    of    killing \nRavana?   The   greatest   souls   in   the   past \nhave     sanctified     disguise     for     a     good \npurpose.  You  will,  likewise,  conquer  your \nenemies and win prosperity.\"  \nYudhishthira  took  leave  of  the  brahmanas \nand  gave  the  members  of  his  retinue  leave  \nto   go   home.   The   Pandavas   retired   to   a \nsecluded  spot  in  the  forest  and  discussed \ntheir    future    line    of    action.    Yudhishthira \nsadly     asked     Arjuna:     \"You     are     well \nconversant   with   the   ways   of   the   world. \nWhere  would  it  be  best  for  us  to  spend  the  \nthirteenth year?\" \nArjuna  replied:    \"O  great  king,  you  know \nYama,  the  Lord  of  Death,  has  blessed  us.  \nWe   can   easily   pass   the   twelve   months \ntogether   without   being   discovered.   There \nare  many  charming  states  for  us  to  choose  \n\nfrom  for  our  sojourn,  states  like  Panchala,  \nMatsya,        Salva,        Videha,        Bahlika, \nDasharna,       Surasena,       Kalinga,       and \nMagadha.   It   is,   of   course,   for   you   to \nchoose.  But  if  I  may  venture  an  opinion, \nthe  Matsya  country  of  king  Virata  is  the \nbest, prosperous and charming as it is.\" \nYudhishthira   answered:   \"Virata,   the   king \nof  Matsya,  is  very  strong  and  he  loves  us  \nmuch.   He   is   of   mature   judgment   and   is \ndevoted  to  the  practice  of  virtue.  He  will \nnot    be    won    over    or    frightened    by \nDuryodhana.  I  agree  that  it  would  be  best  \nto live incognito in Virata's kingdom.\" \nArjuna   said:   \"Well   then,   O   king,   what \nwork   would   you   seek   in   the   court   of \nVirata?\" \nWhen  he  asked  this  question,  Arjuna  was \nfull     of     sorrow     at     the     thought     of \nYudhishthira,   the   great   and   guileless   king, \nwho      had      performed      the      Rajasuya \nsacrifice,   having   to   disguise   himself   and \ntake service. \nYudhishthira   answered:   \"I   am   thinking   of \nasking  Virata  to  take  me  in  his  service  as  a  \ncourtier.    I    could    delight    him    with    my \nconversation   and   my   dexterity   at   dice.   I \nshall take  the  garb  of  a  sanyasin  and  shall \nkeep   him   agreeably   engaged   by   my   skill \nin      reading      omens      and      knowledge \nofastrology    as    well    as    of    the    Vedas, \nVedangas,     ethics,     politics     and     other \nsciences.   I   shall   have   to   be   careful   of \ncourse,   but   be   not   anxious   about   me.   I \nshall  tell  him  that  I  was  an  intimate  friend \nof    Yudhishthira    and    learnt    these    things \nwhile  I  was  privileged  to  be  with  him.  O \nBhima,     what     works     will     you,     who \nconquered   and   slew   Baka   and   Hidimba, \ntake  up  under  Virata?  You  saved  us  by \nkilling   Jatasura. Valor   and   strength   are \nover-flowing  from  you.  What  disguise  can \nhide   your   mighty   personality   and   enable \nyou   to   live   unknown   in   the   country   of \nMastya?\"  Yudhishthira  was  in  tears  as  he \nput this question to Bhima. \nBhima    laughingly    replied:        \"O    king,    I \nthink   of  taking  service  as  a  cook  in  the \ncourt  of  Virata.  You  know  that  I  have  a \ngreat  appetite  and  that  I  am  also  an  expert  \nin    cooking.    I    shall    please    Virata    by \npreparing  such  dainty  food  as  he  has  never  \ntasted.  I  shall  chop  the  trees  of  the  forest  \nand  bring  heaps  of  fuel.  I  shall  also  delight  \nthe  king  by  contending  with  and  defeating \nthe wrestlers who come to his court.\"  \nThis   made   Yudhishthira   anxious   for   he \nfeared   that   danger   might   befall   them   if \nBhima     engaged     himself     in     wrestling \nbouts.  At  once  Bhima  spoke  thus  to  calm  \nhis fears:  \n\"I  shall  not  kill  anyone.  I  may  give  a  bad  \njolt  to  any  wrestler  who  deserves  it  but  I  \nshall  not  kill  anyone.  I  shall  restrain  mad \nbulls,    buffaloes    and    other    wild    animals \nand thus entertain king Virata.\" \nAfterwards         Yudhishthira         addressed \nArjuna:  \"What  profession  do  you  propose \nto   take   up?   How   can   you   hide   your \ntowering valor?\" \nWhen  he  asked  this  question  Yudhishthira \ncould   not   restrain   him   from   narrating   the \nbrilliant   exploits   of   Arjuna.   He   spoke   of \nhis  brother's  glory  in  twenty  verses.  Well,  \nwho deserves praise if not Arjuna? \nArjuna   replied:   \"Revered   brother,   I   shall \nhide  myself  in  the  guise  of  a  eunuch  and \nserve  the  ladies  of  the  court.  I  shall  hide \nunder  a  jacket  the  scars  on  my  arms  made  \nby  the  constant  chafing  of  the  bowstring. \nWhen     I     rejected     Urvasi's     amorous \novertures  on  the  ground  that  she  was  like  \na  mother  unto  me,  she  cursed  me  with  loss  \nof  manhood.  But  through  Indra's  grace  the  \ncurse   would   hold   good   only   for   a   year, \nand  the  time  would  be  mine  to  choose.  I \nshall    serve    out    that year    of    loss    of \nmanhood  now.  Wearing  bangles  made  of \nwhite   conchs,   braiding   my   hair   like   a \nwoman,    and    clothing    myself    in    female \nattire,    I    shall    engage    myself    in    menial \nwork   in   the   inner   apartments   of   Virata's \n\nqueen.   I   shall   teach   the   women   singing \nand   dancing.   And   I   shall   seek   service \nsaying   that   I   used   to   serve   Draupadi   in \nYudhishthira's   court.\"   Saying   this,   Arjuna \nturned to Draupadi and smiled. \nYudhishthira  was  in  tears.  \"Alas!  Have  the  \nfates  decreed  that  he,  who  is  the  equal  of \nSri   Krishna   himself   in   fame  and  valor,  a \nscion   of   Bharata's   line,   who   stands   high \nlike   the   great   golden   Mount   Meru,   must \ngo   and   seek   employment   of   Virata   as   a \neunuch   in   the   queen's   inner   apartments?\" \nhe said brokenly. \nYudhishthira   then   turned   to   Nakula   and \nasked  him  what  work  he  would  engage  in  \nand,  as  he  thought  of  Madri,  the  mother  of  \nNakula, tears rolled down his eyes. \nNakula   replied:   \"I   shall   work   in   King \nVirata's    stables.    My    mind    delights    in \ntraining   and   looking   after   horses.   For   I \nknow    the    heart    of    horses    and    have \nknowledge   of   their   ailments   and   cure.   I \ncan   not   only   ride   and   break   horses   but \nalso  harness  and  drive  them  in  a  chariot.  I  \nshall  say  that  I  had  looked  after  the  horses  \nof   the   Pandavas   and   I   have   no   doubt \nVirata will take me in his service.\" \nYudhishthira   asked   Sahadeva:   \"You,   with \nthe   intelligence   of   Brihaspati,   the   priest \nand   the   preceptor   of   the   gods,   and   the \nknowledge   of   Sukra,   the   teacher   of   the \nasuras, what work will you take up?\"  \nSahadeva   replied:   \"Let   Nakula   look   after \nhorses.  I  shall  tend  the  cows.  I  shall  guard \nVirata's  cattle  from  the  ravages  of  disease  \nand the attacks of wild beasts.\" \n\"O  Draupadi,\"  but  Yudhishthira  could  not \nfind  words  to  ask  her  what  she  proposed  \nto   do.   She   was   dearer   to   him   than   life \nitself,     worthy     of     all     reverence     and \nprotection,  and  it  seemed  sacrilege  to  talk  \nof    service.    She    was    a    princess,    the \ndaughter   of   a   king,   nobly   born,   tenderly \nnurtured.    Yudhishthira    felt    choked    by \nshame and despair.  \nDraupadi   saw   his   grief   and   spoke   these \nbrave   words:   \"O   best   of   kings,   do   not \ngrieve  or  suffer  anxiety  on  my  account.  I \nshall   be   a   sairandhri   in   the   court   of   the \nqueen    of    Virata,    the    companion    and \nattendant  of  the  princess.  I  shall  preserve \nmy  freedom  and  chastity,  for  the  attendant  \nand  companion  of  a  princess  has  this  right  \nand  can  exercise  it.  I  shall  pass  my  days  in  \nsuch   light   tasks   as   braiding   the   hair   and \nentertaining   the   women   of   the   court   with \nsmall  talk.  I  shall  represent  that  I  had  thus  \nserved          princess          Draupadi          in \nYudhishthira's  court  and  seek  employment \nfrom    the    queen.    Thus    shall    I    remain \nunknown to others.\" \nYudhishthira    praised    Draupadi's    courage \nand  said:  \"O  auspicious  one,  you  speak  as  \nbefits one of your family.\" \nWhen     the     Pandavas     thus     decided, \nDhaumya  blessed  them  and  advised  them \nthus:   \"Those   who   are   engaged   in   service \nunder   a   king   should   always   be   vigilant. \nThey    must    serve    without    talking    too \nmuch.   They   may   give   their   counsel   only \nwhen   asked,   and   never   obtrude   it.   They \nshould     praise     the     king     on     befitting \noccasions.    All    things,    no    matter    how \nsmall,   may   be   done   only   after   informing \nthe  king, who  is  a  veritable  fire  in  human \nform.   Do   not   go   too   near   him,   nor   yet \nappear    to    avoid    him.    Even    though    a \nperson   may   be   trusted   by   the   king   and \nhave    great    authority,    still    be    should \nalways    behave    as    if    he    would    be \ndismissed     immediately,     It     would     be \nfoolishness   to   place   too   much   confidence \nin    a    king.    One    may    not    sit    in    the \nconveyance,   seat   or   chariot   of   the   king, \npresuming   on   his   affection.   A   servant   of \nthe   king   should   ever   be   active   and   self-\nrestrained.   He   should   not   be   excessively \nelated,   nor   unduly   depressed,   by   being \nhonored   or   dishonored   by   the   king.   He \nmay   not   reveal   the   secrets   confided   to \nhim,   nor   may   he   receive   anything   in   the \n\nform   of   gift   from   the   citizens.   He   should \nnot  be  jealous  of  other  servants.    The  king  \nmay   place   fools   in   positions   of   authority, \nleaving  aside  the  wise.  Such  waywardness \nshould   be   ignored.   One   cannot   be   too \ncareful  with  the  ladies  of  the  court.  There \nshould   not   be   the   faintest   suggestion   of \nindelicacy     in     one's     conduct     towards \nthem.\"  \nDhaumya    then    blessed    the    Pandavas: \n\"Live    thus    in    patience    for    one    year, \nserving  the  king  Virata,  and  then,  you  will \npass   the   rest   of   your   days   in   happiness, \nregaining your lost throne.\" \n",

But   no   disguise   could   take \naway    their    natural    charm,    grace    and \nnobility of appearance. \nWhen   they   went   to   King   Virata   seeking \nservice,    they    seemed    to    him    born    to \ncommand  and  rule  rather  than  to  serve.  He  \nhesitated,    at    first,    to    engage    them    in \nservice     but     yielding     to     their     urgent \nsolicitations,   he   finally   appointed   them   to \nthe places they sought of him. \nYudhishthira        became        the        king's \ncompanion   and   spent   his   days   in   playing \ndice  with  him.  Bhima  worked  as  the  chief \nof  the  cooks.  He  also  entertained  the  king  \nby   wrestling   with   the   reputed   men   of \nmight   whom   came   to   the   court,   and   by \ncontrolling wild animals. \nArjuna   assumed   the   name   of   Brihannala \nand       taught       dancing,       singing       and \ninstrumental  music  to  Princess  Uttara,  the \ndaughter  of  Virata,  and  the  ladies.  Nakula  \nlooked   after   the   horses   and   Sahadeva \nlooked after the cows and the bulls.  \nThe   princess   Draupadi   who,   if   fate   had \nbeen  less  cruel,  should  herself  have  been \nserved  by  many  maids,  had  now  to  pass \nher   days   in   serving   Sudeshna,   Virata's \nqueen.   She   lived   in   the   inner   apartments \nof   the   palace   as   maid   and   companion, \nengaging herself in uncongenial tasks.  \nKichaka,  the  brother  of  Sudeshna,  was  the  \ncommander-in-chief   of   Virata's   army   and \nit   was   to   him   that   the   old   king   Virata \nowed   his   power   and   prestige.   Kichaka \nwielded   such   vast   influence   that   people \nused  to  say  that  Kichaka  was  the  real  king  \nof  the  Matsya  country  and  old  Virata  king \nonly in name. \nKichaka    was    inordinately    vain    of    his \nstrength   and   his   influence   over   the   king. \nHe  was  so  smitten  with  Draupadi's  beauty \nthat     he     conceived     an     uncontrollable \npassion  for  her.  And  he  was  so  sure  of  his  \nown   attractions   and   power   that   it   never \noccurred  to  him  that  she,  though  a  mere \nmaidservant  could  resist  his  will.  He  made  \namorous   overtures   to   her,   which   greatly \nvexed her.  \nDraupadi  was  too  shy  to  speak  of  this  to  \nSudeshna  or  to  others.  She  gave  out  that \nher     husbands     were     Gandharvas     who \nwould  mysteriously  kill  those  who  tried  to \ndishonor her.  \nHer  good  conduct  and  lustre  made  every \none    believe    in    her    story    about    the \nGandharvas.  But  Kichaka  was  not  to  be \nfrightened     so     easily     and     he     sought \npersistently to seduce Draupadi.  \nHis  persecution  became  so  intolerable  that  \nat   last   she   complained   of   it   to   Queen \nSudeshna,   and   implored   her   protection. \nKichaka,   of   course,  had  greater  influence \nover     his     sister,     and     he     shamelessly \nconfided   to   her   his   unlawful   passion   for \nher  maid  and  sought  her  aid  to  compass \nhis wish. \nHe  represented  himself  as  dying  of  desire.  \n\"I   am   so   full   of   torment,\"   he   said,   \"that \nfrom  the  time  I  met  your  maid,  I  do  not  \nget  any  sleep  or  rest.  You  must  save  my \nlife   by   managing   somehow   to   make   her \nreceive    my    advances    favorably.\"    The \nqueen  tried  to  dissuade  him  but  Kichaka \nwould   not   listen.   And   finally   Sudeshna \n\nyielded.  Both  of  them  decided  upon  a  plan  \nto entrap Draupadi.  \nOne      night,      many      sweetmeats      and \nintoxicating   drinks   were   prepared   in   the \nhouse  of  Kichaka  and  a  great  feast  was \narranged.   Sudeshna   called   Sairandhri   to \nher    side    and    handing    her    a    beautiful \ngolden  jug  bade  her  go  and  bring  her  a  jug  \nof wine from Kichaka's house. \nDraupadi  hesitated  to  go  to  the  house  of \nthe   infatuated   Kichaka   at   that   hour   and \nbegged   hard   that   someone   else   of   her \nmany    attendants    might    be    sent,    but \nSudeshna  did  not  listen.  She  pretended  to  \nbe  angry  and  said  sharply:  \"Go,  you must. \nI   can   not   send   anyone   else,\"   and   poor \nDraupadi had to obey. \nDraupadi's  fears  were  justified.  When  she \nreached    Kichaka's    house,    that    wretch, \nmaddened   with   lust   and   wine,   began   to \npester    her    with    urgent    entreaties    and \nsolicitations.  \nShe   rejected   his   prayers  and  said:  \"Why \ndo   you,   who   belong   to   a   noble   royal \nfamily,   seek   me,   born   of   a   low   caste? \nWhy  do  you  take  to  the  wrong  path?  Why  \ndo  you  approach  me,  a  married  lady?  You  \nwill       perish.       My       protectors,       the \nGandharvas, will kill you in their anger.\" \nWhen   Draupadi   would   not   yield   to   his \nentreaties,  Kichaka  seized  her  by  the  arm \nand   pulled   her   about.   But   putting   down \nthe    vessel    she    carried,    she    wrenched \nherself  free  and  fled,  hotly  pursued  by  the  \nmaddened Kichaka.  \nShe   fled   to   the   court   wailing   loudly.   But \neven    there,    intoxicated    not    only    with \nwine,   but   even   more   by   his   power   and \ninfluence,     Kichaka     followed     her     and \nkicked   her   in   the   presence   of   all   with \nabusive words.  \nEveryone   was   afraid   of   the   all-powerful \ncommander-in-chief  and  no  one  was  bold \nenough to oppose him.  \nDraupadi  could  not  bear  the  sorrow  and \nanger    she    felt    at    the    thought    of    her \nhelplessness    under    the    intolerable    insult \noffered to her.  \nHer   deep   distress   made   her   forget   the \ndanger   that   would   befall   the   Pandavas   if \nthey    were    discovered    prematurely.   She \nwent  that  night  to  Bhima  and  waking  him \nup,   gave   vent   to   her   agonized   sense   of \nwrong. \nAfter    telling    him    how    brutally    Kichaka \nhad     pursued     and     insulted     her,     she \nappealed      piteously      to      Bhima      for \nprotection   and   revenge.   She   said   in   a \nvoice choked with sobs: \n\"I  cannot  bear  this  any  longer.  You  must \nkill  this  wretch  at  once.  For  your  sake,  to  \nhelp  you  keep  your  promise,  I  serve  in  a  \nmenial    office    and    even    prepare    sandal \npaste  for  Virata.  I  have  not  minded  it,  I, \nwho   have   till   now   served   only   you   or \nMother   Kunti,   whom   I   love   and   honor. \nBut  now,  I  have  to  serve  these  wretches, \nfearful   every   moment   of   some   disgraceful \noutrage.  Not  that  I  mind  hard  work,  see \nmy   hands.\"   And   she   showed   her   hands, \nwhich    were    cracked    and    stained    with \nmenial tasks. \nBhima   respectfully carried   her   hands   to \nhis   face   and   eyes,   and   speechless   with \nsorrow   and   pity   and   love,   he   dried   her \ntears.  Finally  he  found  his  voice,  and  said  \nthickly:  \n\"I  care  not  for  the  promise  of  Yudhishthira  \nor  the  advice  of  Arjuna.  I  care  not  what \nmay  happen  but  I  will  do  as  you  say.  I  will  \nkill  Kichaka  and  his  gang  here  and  now!\" \nand he rose. \nBut   Draupadi   warned   Bhima   not   to   be \nhasty.    They    talked    it    over    and    finally \ndecided   that   Kichaka   should   be   beguiled \nto  come  alone  at  night  to  a  retired  spot  in \nthe   dancing   hall where   he   should   find \nwaiting    for    him    Bhima    disguised    as    a \nwoman, instead of Draupadi.  \nNext     morning,     Kichaka     renewed     his \nhateful   attentions   and   vaingloriously   said \nto   Draupadi:   \"O   Sairandhri,   I   threw   you \n\ndown  and  kicked  you  in  the  presence  of \nthe  king.  Did  any  one  there  come  forward  \nto  help  you?  Virata  is  only  king  in  name \nof    this    Matsya    country.    But    I,    the \ncommander-in-chief,        am        the        real \nsovereign.   Now,   do   not   be   a   fool,   but \ncome   and   enjoy   life   with   me,   with   all \nroyal   honors.   I   shall   be   your   devoted \nservant.\"  And  he  begged  and  bullied  and \ncringed,  devouring  her  the  while  with  lust-\nreddened eyes.  \nDraupadi    pretended    to    yield    and    said: \n\"Kichaka,   believe   me,   I   can   no   longer \nresist  your  solicitations.  But  none  of  your \ncompanions   or   brothers   should   know   of \nour   relations.   If   you   swear   that   you   will \nfaithfully   keep   the   secret   from   others,   I \nshall yield to your wish.\" \nKichaka      delightedly      agreed      to      the \ncondition  and  he  promised  to  go  alone  to  a  \nplace of assignation that very night. \nShe  said:  \"The  women  have  their  dancing \nlessons  during  daytime  in  the  dancing  hall \nand    return    to    their    own    quarters    at \nnightfall.  None  will  be  in  the  dancing  hall \nat   night.   Come   there   tonight.   I   shall   be \nwaiting  for  you  there.  You  can  have  your \nwill of me.\" \nKichaka   reveled   in   happiness.   That  night, \nKichaka    took    his    bath,    perfumed    and \ndecked   himself,   went   to   the   dancing   hall \nand  finding  with  joy  that  the  doors  were \nopen, gently entered the place.  \nIn   the   very   dim   light,   he   saw   someone \nlying     there     on     a     couch,     no     doubt \nSairandhri.  He  groped  his  way  in  the  dark,  \nand  gently  laid  his  hands  on  the  person  of \nthe sleeper.  \nAlas!    It    was    not    the    soft    form    of \nSairandhri   that   he   touched   but   the   iron \nframe  of  Bhima  who  lept  forth  on  him  like  \na  lion  on  its  prey  and  hurled  him  to  the \nground.  But  surprised  as  he  was,  Kichaka  \nwas  no  coward,  and  he  was  now  fighting \nfor dear life.  \nGrimly   they   wrestled,   Kichaka   no   doubt \nthinking   he   had   to   do   with   one   of   the \nGandharva   husbands.   They   were   not   ill \nmatched,  for  at  that  time  Bhima,  Balarama  \nand   Kichaka   were   reputed   to   be   in   the \nsame class in strength and wrestling skill.  \nThe  struggle  between  Bhima  and  Kichaka \nwas  like  that  between  Vali  and  Sugriva.  In  \nthe   end   Bhima   killed   Kichaka,   pounding \nand   kneading   his   body   into   a   shapeless \nlump of flesh. \nThen  he  gave  the  glad  news  of  Kichaka's  \npunishment  to  Draupadi  and  went  in  haste  \nto  his  kitchen,  bathed,  rubbed  sandal  paste  \nover his body and slept with satisfaction. \nDraupadi   awoke   the   guards   of   the   court \nand    said    to    them:    \"Kichaka    came    to \nmolest  me,  but  as  I  had  warned  him,  the \nGandharvas,    my    husbands,    made    short \nwork   of   him.   Your   commander-in-chief, \nwho   fell   a   prey   to   lust,   has   been   killed. \nLook  at  him.\"  And  she  showed  them  the \ncorpse    of    Kichaka,    which    had    been \nreduced  to  such  a  shapeless  mass  that  it \nhad no human semblance. \n",

It  would \nbe   best   to   send   her   out   of   the   city.\" \nReflecting    thus,    the    citizens    went    to \nSudeshna   and   prayed   to   her   to   expel \nDraupadi.  \nSudeshna   told Draupadi:   \"You   are,   no \ndoubt,   a   very   virtuous   lady,   but   kindly \nleave our city. I have had enough of you.\" \nThere    was    only    one    month    more    to \ncomplete   the   stipulated   period   of   living \nincognito   and   Draupadi   begged   earnestly \nto  be  permitted  to  stay  just  another  month  \n\nby     when,     she     said,     her     Gandharva \nhusbands     would     have     realised     their \nobjects  and  would  be  ready  to  take  her \naway with them.  \nThe  Gandharvas  would  be  very  grateful  to  \nKing   Virata   and   his   kingdom.   Whether \ngrateful  or  not,  the  Gandharvas  could  be \ndeadly  if  irritated  and  Sudeshna  was  too \nafraid of Draupadi to refuse her request.  \nFrom  the  beginning  of  the  thirteenth  year, \nthe    spies    of    Duryodhana,    under    his \nexpress    orders,    had    searched    for    the \nPandavas in all possible places of hiding.  \nAfter  several  months  of  futile  search,  they \nreported   their   failure   to   Duryodhana   and \nadded   that   probably   the   Pandavas   had \nperished of privations.  \nThen   came   the   news   that   the   powerful \nKichaka  had  been  killed  in  single  combat \nby   some   Gandharva   on   account   of   a \nwoman.  \nThere   were  only  two  persons  who  could \nkill  Kichaka,  and  Bhima  was  one  of  them.  \nAnd   so   they   suspected   that   Bhima   might \nhave   been   the   vengeful   Gandharva   who \nhad   killed   Kichaka.   Duryodhana   also   felt \nthat   the   lady   who   was   the   cause   of   the \nkilling   might   be   Draupadi.   He   expressed \nhis doubts in the open assembly. \nHe  said:  \"I  suspect  that  the  Pandavas  are \nin   Virata's   city.   Now,   he   is   one   of   the \nkings  who  are  too  stiff-necked  to  court  our  \nfriendship.   It   would   be   a   good   thing   to \ninvade   his   country   and   carry   away   his \ncows.   If   the   Pandavas   are   hiding   there, \nthey   will   certainly   come   out   to   fight   with \nus  to  repay  Virata's  hospitality  and  we  can  \neasily   spot   them.   If   we   discover   them \nthere  and  we  can  sure  before  the  stipulated  \ntime,   they   will   have   to   go   to   the   forest \nagain  for  another  twelve,  years.  If,  on  the  \nother   hand,   the   Pandavas   are   not   there, \nthere is nothing lost.\"  \nKing    Susarma,    the    ruler    of    Trigarta \nheartily    supported    him.    \"The    king    of \nMatsya    is    my    enemy.\"    he    said,    \"and \nKichaka   has   given   me   a   lot   of   trouble. \nKichaka's    death    must    have    weakened \nVirata    considerably.    Give    me    leave    to \nattack Virata now.\" \nKarna    seconded    this    proposition.    They \nunanimously    came    to    the    decision    that \nSusarma   should   attack   Matsya   from   the \nsouth  and  draw  off  the  army  of  Virata  to  \nthe   south   for   defence.   Duryodhana,   with \nthe   Kaurava   army,   would   then   launch   a \nsurprise     attack     on     Virata     from     the \nnorthern   side,   which   would   be   relatively \nundefended.  \nSusarma   invaded   Matsya   from   the   south \nseized    the    cattle    and    laid    waste    the \ngardens    and    fields    on    the    way.    The \ncowherds   ran   in   great   distress   to   Virata, \nwho  now  very  much  wished  that  Kichaka \nwere  alive,  for  he  surely  would  have  made  \nshort  work  of  the  raiders.  When  he  said  so  \nto   Kanka   (the   assumed   name   by   which \nYudhishthira  was  known  in  Virata's  court) \nthe   latter   said:   \"O   king,   be   not   worried. \nEven  though  I  am  a  hermit,  I  am  an  expert  \nin  warfare.  I  shall  put  on  armor  and  go  in \na   chariot   and   drive   away   your   enemies. \nPlease    instruct    that    your    horse    keeper \nDharmagranthi,    your    chief    cook    Valala, \nand  your  stable  herd  Tantripala  may  also \nget  into  chariots  and  help  us.  I  have  heard  \nthat   they   are   great   fighters.   Kindly   give \norders  that  the  necessary  chariots  and  the \nweapons may be given to us.\" \nDelighted,   Virata   was   only   too   willing   to \naccept  the  offer.  The  chariots  were  ready. \nAll   the   Pandavas   excepting   Arjuna   went \nout   with   the   army   of   Virata   to   oppose \nSusarma and his men.  \nA  fierce  fight  ensued  between  the  armies \nof  Virata  and  Susarma,  with  much  loss  of \nlife    on    both    sides.    Susarma    attacked \nVirata     and     surrounded     his     chariot, \ncompelling  him  to  get  down  and  fight  on \nfoot.  \nSusarma   captured   Virata   and   held   him \ncaptive  in  his  chariot.  With  the  capture  of \n\nVirata,  the  army  of  Matsya  lost  heart  and  \nbegan   to   scatter   in   all   directions,   when \nYudhishthira   commanded   Bhima   to   attack \nSusarma  and  release  Virata  and  rally  the \nscattered Matsya forces.  \nAt   these   words   of   Yudhishthira,   Bhima \nwas     about     to     uproot     a     tree,     but \nYudhishthira   stopped   him   and   said:   \"No \nsuch  tricks,  please,  and  no  battle  cry  or \nyour   identity   will   be   revealed.   Fight   like \nanybody   else   from   the   chariot   with   your \nbows and arrows.\" \nBhima    accordingly    got    into    the    chariot \nattacked   the   enemy,   set   Virata   free   and \ncaptured  Susarma.  The  dispersed  forces  of  \nMatsya     rallied     into     new     formations \ncharged     and     defeated     the     army     of \nSusarma. \nAs  soon  as  the  news  of  Susarma's  defeat  \nreached     the     city,     the     people     were \nextremely    jubilant.    They    decorated    the \ncity    and    went    forth    to    welcome    their \nvictorious king back home.  \nWhen  they  were  thus  making  preparations \nto   receive   king   Virata,   the   big   army   of \nDuryodhana  came  down  on  them  from  the  \nnorth,    and    began    despoiling    the    cattle \nranches on the outskirts of the city.  \nThe  Kaurava  army  marched  in  force  and \nrounded  up  the  countless  cows  that  were \nthere.  The  leader  of  the  cowherds  ran  to \nthe  city  and  said  to  the  prince  Uttara:  \"O  \nprince,   the   Kauravas   are   marching   on, \nrobbing  us  of  our  cows.  King  Virata  has \ngone   south   to   fight   against   the   Trigarta. \nWe  are  in  consternation  as  there  is  no  one  \nto  protect  us.  You  are  the  king's  son  and  \nwe  look  to  you  for  protection.  Pray,  come  \nand   recover   the   cows   for   the   honor   of \nyour family.\"  \nWhen   the   leader   of   the   cowherds   made \nthis  complaint  to  Uttara  in  the  presence  of \nthe  people  and  especially  of  the  women  of  \nthe   palace,   the   prince   felt   flushed   with \nvalor and proudly said:  \n\"If   only   I   can   get   someone   to   be   my \ncharioteer  I  will  recover  the  cows  single-\nhanded.   Well,   my   feats   of   arms   will   be \nworth  seeing  and  people  will  know  there \nis   little   to   choose   between   Arjuna   and \nmyself.\" \nWhen   Uttara   said   these   words   Draupadi \nwas  in  the  inner  apartments  and  must  have  \nlaughed within herself.  \nShe  ran  to  princess  Uttara  and  said:  \"O \nprincess,   great   danger   has   be   fallen   the \ncountry.   The   cowherds   have   complained \nto   the   young   that   the   Kaurava   army   is \nadvancing  on  our  city  from  the  north  and \nhas  captured  cattle  ranches  and  cows  on \nthe  outskirts.  The  prince  is  eager  to  fight \nthem   and   is   in   need   of   a   charioteer. \nShould  such  a  small  thing  as  that  stand  in \nthe  way  of  victory  and  glory?  I  tell  you \nthat      Brihannala      has      been      Arjuna's \ncharioteer.  When  I  was  in  the  service  of \nthe  queen  of  the  Pandavas,  I  heard  of  this  \nfact  and  I  also  know  that  Brihannala  learnt  \narchery    from    Arjuna.    Order    Brihannala \nimmediately   to   go   and   drive   the   prince's \nchariot.\" \nArjuna    as    Brihannala    pretended    to    be \nunfamiliar   with   armor   and   raised   a   laugh \nat his awkwardness in wearing it.  \nThe  women  of  the  palace  laughed  at  his \nfears  and  told  him  again  not  to  be  afraid \nfor Uttara would look after him.  \nArjuna   spent   some   time   in   such   fun   but, \nwhen  he  harnessed  the  horses,  it  could  be  \nseen   that,   at   least,   he   was   an   expert \ncharioteer.   And   when   he   held   the   reins, \nthe horses seemed to love and obey him. \n\"The   prince   will   be   victorious.   We   shall \ndespoil   the   enemy   of   their   embroidered \nrobes   and   distribute   them   to   you   as   the \nprize   of   victory\"   were   the   last   words   of \nBrihannala  to  the  women  of  the  palace,  as  \nthe     chariot     rapidly     bore     the     prince \noutwards to battle.  \n",

      "content": "\n\nUTTARA,  the  son  of  Virata,  set  off  with \nenthusiasm   from   the   city   in   his   chariot \nwith    Brihannala    as    his    charioteer    and \ncommanded  the  latter  to  drive  quickly  to \nthe  place  where  the  Kauravas  had  rounded  \nup the cows. \nWillingly,  the  horses  were  put  to  their  best  \nspeed.   And   presently   the   Kaurava   army \nwas    sighted,    at    first    a    gleaming,    line, \nenveloped  in  a  cloud  of  dust  that  seemed \nto go up to the skies.  \nGoing  nearer,  Uttara  saw  the  great  army \ndrew  in  battle  by  Bhishma,  Drona,  Kripa, \nDuryodhana  and  Karna.  At  that  sight,  his \ncourage,  which  had  been  gradually  drying \nup  during  the  rapid  rush  to  the  field,  was \nquite   gone.   His   mouth   went   dry  and  his \nhair stood on end. \nHis  limbs  were  all  in  a  tremble.  He  shut \nhis  eyes  with  both  his  hands  to  keep  out \nthe   fearsome   sight.   He   said:\"How   can   I, \nsingle-handed,  attack  an  army?  I  have  no \ntroops,   since   the   king,   my   father,   has \ntaken  all  available  forces,  leaving  the  city \nunprotected.  It  is  absurd  to  think  that  one  \nman    can    alone    fight    a    well-equipped \narmy,  led  by  world-renowned  warrior!  Oh  \nBrihannala, turn back the chariot.\" \nBrihannala   laughed   and   said:   \"O   prince, \nyou   started   from   the   city,   full   of   fierce \ndetermination   and   the   ladies   expect   great \nthings  of  you.  The  citizens  also  have  put \ntheir   trust   in   you.   Sairandhri   praised   me \nand  I  have  come  at  your  request.  If  we \nreturn   without   recovering   the   cows,   we \nshall   become   the   laughing-stock   of   all.   I \nwill  not  turn  back  the  chariot.  Let  us  stand  \nfirm  and  fight.  Have  no  fear.\"  With  these \nwords    Brihannala    began    to    drive    the \nchariot    towards    the    enemy    and    they \napproached quite close to them.  \nUttara's  distress  was  pitiable.  He  said  in  a  \nquaking   voice:   \"I   cannot   do   it,   I   simply \ncannot.  Let  the  Kauravas  march  off  with \nthe   cows   and   if   the   women   laugh,   let \nthem.  I  do  not  care.  What  sense  is  there  in  \nfighting    people    who    are    immeasurably \nstronger  than  we  fight?  Do  not  be  a  fool!  \nTurn  back  the  chariot.  Otherwise,  I  shall \njump   out   and   walk   back.\"   With   these \nwords    Uttara    cast    off    his    bows    and \narrows,   got   down   from   the   chariot   and \nbegan   to   fly   towards   the   city,   mad   with \npanic.  \nThis  should  not  be  taken  as  something  that  \nhas  never  happened  in  life.  Nor  is  Uttara's  \npanic  during  his  first  battle,  by  any  means,  \nsingular.  \nFear  is  a  strong  instinctive  feeling,  though \nit   can   be   overcome   by   will-power   or \nstrong  motives  like  love,  shame  or  hate,  or  \nmore usually, by discipline. \nEven      men      who      have      afterwards \ndistinguished   themselves   by   heroic   deeds \nhave   confessed   to   having   felt   something \nlike   panic   fear,   the   first   time   they   came \nunder   fire.   Uttara   was   by   no   means   an \nexceptional  coward,  for  he  fought  and  fell \ngauntly at Kurukshetra. \nArjuna     pursued     the     running     prince, \nshouting  to  him  to  stop  and  behave  like  a  \nKshatriya.     The     braided     hair     of     the \ncharioteer  began  to  dance  and  his  clothes \nbegan   to   wave   as   he   ran   in   pursuit   of \nUttara.  The  prince  fled  hither  and  thither, \ntrying  to  dodge  the  hands  that  would  stop  \nhim.  \nThose   of   the   Kaurava   army,   who   could \nsee    this    spectacle,    found    it    amusing. \nDrona    was    puzzled    at    the    sight    of \nBrihannala         who,         albeit         dressed \nfantastically,  seemed  a  man  rigged  out  as \na  woman  and  to  remind  him  curiously  of \nArjuna. \nWhen  he  remarked  about  this,  Karna  said: \n\"How   can   this   be  Arjuna?  What  does  it \nmatter   even   if   he   is?   What   can   Arjuna \nalone  do  against  us  in  the  absence  of  the \nother  Pandavas?  The  king  has  left  his  son \nalone  in  the  city  and  gone  with  his  whole \narmy  to  fight  against  Susarma.  The  young \nprince   has   brought   the   attendant   of   the \n\nladies  of  the  palace  as  his  charioteer.  That  \nis all.\" \nPoor   Uttara   was   imploring   Brihannala   to \nlet   him   go,   promising   untold   wealth   if   he \ndid  so.  He  appealed  to  his  pity:  \"I  am  the  \nonly   son   of   my   mother.   I   am   a   child \ngrown  up  on  my  mother's  lap.  I  am  full  of  \nfear.\"  \nBut,  Brihannala  wanted  to  save  him  from \nhimself,   and   would   not   let   him   go.   He \npursued  him,  seized  him  and  dragged  him \nto the chariot by force.  \nUttara  began  to  sob  and  said:  \"What  a  fool  \nI  was  to  brag!  Alas!  What  will  happen  to  \nme?\"  \nArjuna   said   kindly,   soothing   the   prince's \nfears:  \"Be  not  afraid.  I  shall  fight  with  the  \nKauravas.   Help   me   by   looking   after   the \nhorses  and  driving  the  chariot,  and  I  shall \ndo   the   rest.   Believe   me,   no   good   ever \ncame   of   flight.   We   will   rout   the   enemy \nand  recover  your  cows.  You  will  have  all \nthe  glory.\"  With  these  words  Arjuna  lifted \nthe   prince   on   to   the   chariot   and,   putting \nthe  reins  in  his  hands,  asked  him  to  drive  \ntowards a tree near the burial ground. \nDrona,  who  was  watching  all  this  intently, \nknew     that     the fantastically     dressed \ncharioteer    was    Arjuna    and    shared    his \nknowledge with Bhishma.  \nDuryodhana   turned   to   Karna   and   said: \n\"Why  should  we  worry  who  he  is?  Even  if  \nhe  is  Arjuna,  he  will  be  only  playing  into \nour   hands,   for   his   being discovered   will \nsend  the  Pandavas  to  the  forest  for  another  \ntwelve years.\" \nAs   soon   as   they   came   near   the   tree \nBrihannala    bade    the    prince    get    down, \nclimb   the   tree   and   take   down   the   arms \nhidden  there.  The  prince  said  in  alarm  and  \ngrief:  \"People  say  that  what  hangs  on  this \ntree  is  the  corpse  of  an  old  huntress.  How  \ncan  I  touch  a  dead  body?  How  can  you \nask me to do such a thing?\" \nArjuna  said:  \"It  is  not  a  corpse,  prince.  I \nknow  that  it  contains  the  weapons  of  the \nPandavas.  Climb  up  the  tree  bravely  and \nbring them down. Do not delay.\" \nSeeing   that   resistance   was   of   no   avail \nUttara   climbed   up   the   tree   as   Brihannala \nhad   asked   him   to   and   took,   in   great \ndisgust,   the   bag   tied   up   there   and   came \ndown.  \nWhen  the  leather  bag  was  opened,  he  saw  \nweapons  as  bright  as  the  sun.  Uttara  stood  \namazed    at    the    sight    of    the    gleaming \nweapons and covered his eyes.  \nHe   mustered   courage   and   touched   them. \nThe   touch   seemed   to   send   a   stream   of \nhope  and  high  courage  into  him.  He  asked  \nwith  ardor:  \"O  charioteer,  what  a  wonder!  \nYou   say   that   these   bows,   arrows   and \nswords  belong  to  the  Pandavas.  They  have  \nbeen  deprived  of  their  kingdom  and  they \nhave  retired  to  the  forest.  Do  you  know \nthem? Where are they?\"  \nThen   Arjuna   told   him   briefly   how   they \nwere    all    in    Virata's    court.    He    said: \n\"Kanka,     who     serves     the     king,     is \nYudhishthira.     Valala,     the     cook     who \nprepares  such  nice  dishes  for  your  father, \nis  none  other  than  Bhima.  Sairandhri,  for \ninsulting    whom    Kichaka    was    killed,    is \nDraupadi.  Dharmagranthi,  who  looks  after \nthe   horses   and   Tantripala,   the   keeper   of \nthe    cows,    are    Nakula    and    Sahadeva \nrespectively.  I  am  Arjuna.  Be  not  afraid. \nO  prince,  you  will  soon  see  me  defeat  the  \nKauravas   even   in   the   sight   of   Bhishma, \nDrona   and   Aswatthama   and   recover   the \ncows.   You   will   also   gain   renown   and   it \nwill be a lesson to you.\" \nThen  Uttara  folded  his  hands  and  said:  \"O  \nArjuna,   how   fortunate   I   am   to   see   you \nwith   my   own   eyes!   So,   Arjuna   is   the \nvictorious   hero   whose   very   contact   has \nput  heart  and  courage  into  me.  Forgive  the  \nwrongs I have done through ignorance.\" \nAs   they   approached   the   Kaurava   host, \nArjuna recounted    some    of    his    heroic \ndeeds,  so  that  Uttara  might  not  lose  grip  of  \nhis   newly   awakened   courage.   Arriving   in \n\nfront    of    the    Kauravas,    he    got    down, \nprayed    to    God,    removed    the    conch-\nbangles  from  his  hands  and  put  on  leather  \ngauntlets. \nHe  then  tied  a  cloth  on  his  flowing  hair, \nstood   facing   the   east,   meditated   on   his \narmor,  got  into  the  chariot  and  gloried  in \nthe   familiar   feel   of   his   famous   Gandiva \nbow.  He  stringed  it  and  thrice  twanged  the  \nstring   whose   shrill   note   raised   an   echo \nfrom all sides.  \nHearing    the   sound,   the   heroes   of   the \nKaurava  army  said  to  one  another:  \"This \nsurely   is   Gandiva's   voice.\"   When   Arjuna \nstood   on   the   chariot   in   all   his   godlike \nstature  and  blew  his  conch  Devadatta,  the  \nKaurava  army  was  alarmed  and  a  frenzied  \nshout arose that the Pandavas had come.  \nThe  story  of  Uttara,  who  spoke  boastfully \nin  the  ladies'  boudoirs  and  fled  in  panic  at  \nthe  sight  of  the  hostile  array,  his  not  been \nintroduced  in  the  Mahabharata,  merely  as \na comic interlude. \nIt  is  in  ordinary  human  nature  to  look  with  \ncontempt   on   lower   levels   of   conduct   in \nability.    The    rich    scorn    the    poor,    the \nbeautiful   scorn   the   plain,   and   the   strong \nscorn    the    weak.    Brave    men    despise \ncowards.   But   Arjuna   was   no   ordinary \nman.  He  was  a  great  soul  and  a  true  hero  \nwho  felt  that  his  duty  as  a  strong,  brave  \nman  was  to  help  others  to  rise  above  their  \nweakness. \nKnowing   that   nature   had   endowed   him \nwith  courage  and  bravery  at  birth,  and  that  \nhe  owed  them  to  no  special  exertions  on \nhis   part,   he   had   the   true   humility   of   the \nreally  great.  And  he  did  what  he  could  to  \nput   courage   into   Uttara   and   make   him \nworthy   of   his   lineage.   This   was   Arjuna's \ncharacteristic   nobility.   He   never   abused \nhis  strength  and  power.  One  of  his  many \nnames  is  Bibhatsu,  which  means  one  who \nshrank   from   doing   an   unworthy   act,   and \nhe lived up to it. \n",

The \nhearts  of  the  Kauravas  quaked  when  they \nheard the twang of the Gandiva bow. \n\"Our  army  must  be  arrayed  well  and  with \ncare.    Arjuna,    has    come,\"    said    Drona \nanxiously.   Duryodhana   did   not   at   all   like \nthe    honor    Drona    did    Arjuna    by    this \nanxiety.  \nHe  said  to  Karna:  \"The  Pandavas'  pledge \nwas  that  they  would  spend  twelve  years  in  \nthe     forest     and     the     following     year \nundiscovered.  The  thirteenth  year  has  not \nended   yet.   Arjuna   has   revealed   himself \nbefore  the  time.  Why  then  should  we  give  \nway  to  fear?  The  Pandavas  will  have  to  go  \nagain   to   the   forest   for   another   twelve \nyears.   Drona   is   suffering   from   the   cold \nfeet  of  the  too  learned.  Let  us  leave  him  in  \nthe rear and advance to the battle.\" \nKarna   assented   and   said:   \"Our   soldiers' \nheart   is   not   in   the   fight   and   they   are \ntrembling   with   fear.   They   say   that   the \nman,  who  stands  so  proudly,  bow  in  hand,  \non   the   chariot,   speeding   towards   us,   is \nArjuna.  But  why  need  we  fear  even  if it \nwere   Parasurama?   I   will   myself   stop   the \nadvancing  warrior  and  redeem  my  word  to  \nyou,   and   fight   him,   aye,   even   if   all   the \nothers  stand  back.  They  may  drive  away \nthe  cows  of  the  Matsya  king  while,  single  \nhanded,  I  shall  give  them  cover,  engaging \nArjuna   in   battle,\"   and   Karna,   as   usual, \nbegan to blow his own trumpet. \nWhen  Kripa  heard  these  words  of  Karna,  \nhe   said:   \"This   is   pure   tomfoolery.   We \nmust    all    make    a    combined    attack    on \nArjuna.  That  would  be  our  one  chance  of \nsuccess.  Do  not  therefore,  brag  about  your \nopposing him alone and unaided.\"  \nKarna  grew  angry.  He  said:  \"The  acharya \never   delights   in   singing   Arjuna's   praises \nand   in   magnifying   his   prowess.   Whether \nhe    does    so    from    fear    or    excessive \nfondness  for  the  Pandavas,  I  do  not  know.  \nThose,  who  are  afraid,  need  not  fight,  but  \n\nmay  simply  look  on,  while  others,  who  are  \ntrue  to  the  salt  they  have  eaten,  engage  in \nbattle.  I,  for  one,  a  mere  soldier  who  loves  \nmy   friends   and   hates   my   enemies,   will \nstand  here  and  fight.  What  business  have \nmen  learned  in  the  Vedas,  who  love  and  \npraise   their   enemies,   got   here?\"   said   he \nsneeringly.  \nAswatthama,    Drona's    son    and    Kripa's \nnephew,    could    not    hear    unmoved    this \nsneer   at   the   venerable   teachers.   He   said \nsternly  to  Karna:  \"We  have  not  yet  taken \nthe   king   back   to   Hastinapura,   and   the \nbattle  is  yet  to  be  won.  Your  brag  is  idle  \nvainglory.   It   may   be   that   we   are   not \nkshatriyas  and  that  we  belong  to  the  class  \nthat  recites  the  Vedas  and  the  sastras.  But  \nI  have  not  been  able  to  find  in  any  sastra  \nthat   it   is   honor   able   for   kings   to   seize \nkingdoms  by  cheating  at  dice.  Even  those,  \nwho  fight  and  conquer  kingdoms,  do  not \ncrow  too  loudly  about  it.  And  I  cannot  see  \nwhat  you  have  done  to  be  proud  of.  The  \nfire  is  silent  and  yet  cooks  the  food.  The \nsun    shines    but    not    on    him.    Likewise, \nMother   earth   sustains   all   things,   movable \nand   immovable,   and   supports   her   burden \nwithout  so  much  as  a  whisper.  What  claim  \nto    praise    has    a    kshatriya    who    has \nunlawfully   seized   another's   kingdom   at   a \ngame    of    dice?    To    have    cheated    the \nPandavas  of  their  kingdom  is  no  more  a \nmatter  of  glory  than  to  have  spread  traps \nfor  unsuspecting  birds.  O  Duryodhana,  O \nKarna,   in   what   battle   did   your   heroes \ndefeat     the     Pandavas?     You     dragged \nDraupadi  to  the  assembly.  Are  you  proud  \nof   it?   You   have   destroyed   the   Kaurava \nrace  like  an  empty-headed  clod  that  fells  a  \nbig  sandal  tree  for  love  of  its  fragrance.  A \nfight  with  Arjuna,  you  will  find,  is  a  very \ndifferent   thing   from   a   throw   of   the   dice. \nThe  Gandiva  will  send  forth  sharp  arrows \nand  not  fours  and  twos  as  in  the  game  of \ndice.  Vain  fools,  do  you  think  that  Sakuni  \ncan,  by  mere  cheating,  sneak  a  victory  in \nbattle for you?\" \nThe  leaders  of  the  Kaurava  army  lost  their  \npatience  and  began  a  loud  wordy  warfare.  \nSeeing   this,   the   grandsire   was   filled   with \nsorrow and said: \n\"The    wise    man    does    not    insult    his \nteachers.  One  should  engage  in  battle  only \nafter   a   careful   calculation   of   time,   place \nand  circumstance.  Even  wise  people  often \nlose   their   balance   and   good   sense   over \ntheir   own   affairs.   Ruffled   by   anger,   even \nthe   usually   so   sensible   Duryodhana   fails \nto   recognise  that  the  warrior  who  stands \nbraving   our   army   is   Arjuna.   His   intellect \nhas      been      clouded      by      anger.      O \nAswatthama,   pray   do   not   mind   Karna's \noffensive  remarks.  You  must  take  them  as  \nintended  merely  to  put  the  preceptors  on \ntheir  best  spirit  and  sting  them  into  action.  \nThis   is   not   the   time   to   nurse   enmity   or \nsow     dissension.     Drona,     Kripa     and \nAswatthama    should    forget    and    forgive. \nWhere  can  the  Kauravas  find  in  the  whole  \nworld,    heroes    superior    to    Drona,    the \npreceptor,  and  his  son  Aswatthama,  who \ncombine   in   themselves   Vedic   scholarship \nand  kshatriya  heroism?  We  know  of  none  \nother    than    Parasurama    who    can    equal \nDrona.  We  can  conquer  Arjuna  only  if  we  \nall   join   together   and   fight   him.   Let   us \naddress  ourselves  to  the  task  before  us.  If \nwe   quarrel   amongst   ourselves   we   cannot \nfight Arjuna.\" \nThus  spoke  the  grandsire.  Soothed  by  his \nnoble    words,    angry    feelings    subsided. \nBhishma     turned     to     Duryodhana     and \ncontinued: \n\"Best   of   kings,   Arjuna   has   come.   The \nstipulated      period      of      thirteen      years \nterminated   yesterday.   Your   calculation is \nwrong,  as  men  learned  in  the  science  of \nplanetary  movements  will  tell  you.  I  knew \nthat   the   period   had   ended   when   Arjuna \nblew   his   conch.   Reflect   a   little   before \ndeciding   on   war.   If   you   wish   to   make \n\npeace  with  the  Pandavas,  now  is  the  time  \nfor   it.   What   do   you   seek,   a   just   and \nhonorable  peace  or  a  mutually  destructive \nwar? Ponder well and make your choice.\" \nDuryodhana  replied:  \"Revered  sire,  I  have \nno  wish  for  peace.  I  shall  not  give  even  a  \nvillage  to  the  Pandavas.  Let  us  get  ready \nfor war.\" \nThen  Drona  said:  \"Let  prince  Duryodhana \ntake  away  a  fourth  of  the  army  to  guard \nhim  and  return  to  Hastinapura.  Let  another  \nsurround  the  cows  and  seize  them.  If  we \nreturn   without   seizing   the   cows   it   would \namount   to   an   acknowledgment   of   defeat. \nWith  the  rest  of  the  army,  the  five  of  us  \nwill give battle to Arjuna.\"  \nThe    Kaurava    forces    ranged    themselves \naccordingly   in   battle   array.   Arjuna   said: \n\"O   Uttara,   I   do   not   see   Duryodhana's \nchariot   or   Duryodhana.   I   see   Bhishma \nstanding,      clad      in      armor.      I      think \nDuryodhana   is   driving   away  the  cows  to \nHastinapura.    Let    us    pursue    him    and \nrecover    the    cows.\"    With    these    words \nArjuna   moved   away   from   the   Kaurava \narmy  and  went  after  Duryodhana  and  the \ncows.  \nAnd   as   he   was   going,   he   respect   fully \ngreeted  his  teachers  and  the  old  grandsire,  \nby  drawing  his  Gandiva  bow  and  sending \narrows so as to fall near their feet.  \nReverently    saluting    them    in    this    heroic \nfashion,     he     left     them     and     pursued \nDuryodhana.    Arjuna    reached    the    place \nwhere  the  cows  were  gathered  and  put  to  \nrout the marauding forces.  \nHe  then  turned  to  the  cowherds  and  asked  \nthem  to  take  the  cows  to  the  barns,  which  \nthey  did  with  great  rejoicing.  Arjuna  then \npursued       Duryodhana.       Seeing       this, \nBhishma   and   the   other   Kaurava   warriors \nrushed    to    the    rescue    and,    surrounding \nArjuna, sent forth arrows against him. \nArjuna  carried  on  a  wonderful  fight.  First, \nhe  made  at  Karna  and  drove  him  from  the  \nbattlefield.   After   that,   he   attacked   and \ndefeated   Drona.   Seeing   Drona   standing \nspent   with   fatigue,   Aswatthama   joined   in \nthe  fight  and  attacked  Arjuna,  which  gave \nArjuna   an   opportunity   of   letting   Drona \nwithdraw from the field.  \nThen,    there    ensued    a    bitter    struggle \nbetween   Aswatthama   and   Arjuna.   When \nAswatthama   grew   weary,   Kripa   relieved \nhim    and    maintained    the    attack    against \nArjuna.  \nBut   Kripa   also   sustained   defeat and   the \nwhole  army  was  routed  and  fled  in  fear. \nThough   rallied   and   brought   back   to   the \nattack   by   Bhishma,   Drona   and   others, \nthere   was   no   fight   left   in   them.   Finally, \nthey   left   the   field,   after   a   glorious   fight \nbetween  Bhishma  and  Arjuna,  which,  it  is \nsaid, the gods themselves came to see. \nThe   attempt   to   head   off   Arjuna’s   pursuit \nof    Duryodhana    thus    failed    and    soon \nArjuna   came   up   with   Duryodhana   and \nstrongly   attacked   him.   Duryodhana   was \ndefeated  and  fled  from  the  battlefield,  but \nnot  far,  because,  when  Arjuna  taunted  him  \nwith   cowardice,   he   turned   round   like   a \nserpent and resumed the fight.  \nBhishma     and     others     surrounded     and \nprotected   him.   Arjuna   fought   and   finally, \nhe  employed  a  magic  weapon  that  made \nthem   all   fall   down   unconscious   on   the \nbattlefield.     While     they     were     in     that \ncondition      he      snatched      away      their \ngarments.  The  seizure  of  the  clothes  of  the  \nenemy  was  the  sign  of  decisive  victory  in \nthose days. \nWhen   Duryodhana   came,   Bhishma   sent \nhim   back   to   the   city.   The   whole   army \nreturned      to      Hastinapura      after      this \nhumiliating defeat.  \nArjuna   said:   \"O   Uttara,   turn   back   the \nhorses.  Our  cows  have  been  regained.  Our  \nenemies   have   fled.   O   prince,   return   to \nyour  kingdom,  adorning  your  person  with \nsandal paste and decked with flowers.\"  \nOn   the   way   back,   Arjuna   deposited   the \nweapons  as  before  on  the  tree  and  dressed  \n\nhimself  once  more  as  Brihannala.  He  sent \nmessengers  in  advance  to  proclaim  in  the \ncity    that    Uttara    had    won    a    glorious \nvictory. \n",

      "content": "\nAFTER     defeating     Susarma,     king     of \nTrigarta,    Virata    returned    to    his capital \namidst   the   acclamations   of   the   citizens. \nWhen  he  reached  his  palace,  he  saw  that \nUttara  was  not  there  and  the  womenfolk \ntold  him  with  much  elation  that  Uttara  had  \nset out to conquer the Kauravas.  \nThey  had  not  a  doubt  that  their  hand  some  \nprince   could   conquer   the   whole   world. \nBut  the  king's  heart  sank  within  him  at  the  \nnews,   for   he   knew   the   impossible   task \nwhich   the   delicately   nurtured   prince   had \ntaken   on   himself   with   no   better   following \nthan a eunuch.  \n\"My   dearly   loved   son   must   be   dead   by \nnow,\"      he cried,     overwhelmed     with \nanguish.    He    then    bade    his    ministers \ncollect  and  send  as  strong  a  force  as  could  \nbe  got  together  for  rescuing  Uttara  if  he \nwas  still  alive  and  bring  him  back.  Scouts  \nalso  were  immediately  despatched  to  find \nout Uttara's whereabouts and fate.  \nDharmaputra,     now     disguised     as     the \nsanyasin  Kanka,  tried  to  comfort  Virata  by  \nassuring  him  that  the  prince  could  come  to  \nno  harm,  since  Brihannala  had  gone  as  his  \ncharioteer.  \"You  do  not  know  about  her,\" \nsaid  he.  \"I  do.  Whosoever  fights  from  a \nchariot   driven   by   her,   can   be   sure   of \nvictory.   Further,   the   news   of   Susarma's \ndefeat   must   have   reached   there   and   the \nKauravas must have retreated.\" \nMeanwhile  courtiers  arrived  from  the  field \nof   battle   with   the   glad   news   that   Uttara \nhad    defeated    the    Kaurava    forces    and \nrecovered the kine.  \nThis  seemed  too  good  to  be  true,  even  to  \nthe      fond      father,      but      Yudhishthira \nsmilingly   reassured   him.   Said   he:   \"Have \nno  doubts,  O  king.  What  the  messengers \nsay  must  be  true.  When  Brihannala  went \nout   as   charioteer,   success   was   certain. \nThere    is    nothing    extraordinary    in    your \nson's  victory.  I  happen  to  know  that  even \nIndra's    charioteer    or    Krishna's    cannot \nequal Brihannala.\" \nThis  seemed  absurd  to  Virata,  but  he  was  \ntoo  happy  to  resent  it.  He  made  large  gifts  \nof  precious  stones  and  other  wealth  to  the  \nmessengers   who   brought   the   good   news \nand  ordered  public  rejoicing.  \"My  success \nover   Susarma   is   nothing,\"   he   proclaimed. \n\"The    prince's    is    the    real    victory.    Let \nspecial  prayers  of  thanksgiving  be  offered \nat    all    places    of    worship.    Let    all    the \nprincipal   streets   are   decorated   with   flags \nand    the    citizen’s    go    in    procession    to \nstrains    of    triumphal    music.    Make    all \narrangements    to    receive,    in    a    befitting \nmanner, my lion-hearted boy.\" \nVirata   sent   out   ministers,   soldiers,   and \nmaidens   to   welcome   his   son,  returning  in \ntriumph.   When   the   king   retired   to   his \nprivate  apartments,  he  asked  Sairandhri  to  \nbring  the  dice.  He  said  to  Kanka:  \"I  cannot  \ncontain  my  joy.  Come,  let  us  play,\"  and \nsat down to a game with Yudhishthira. \nThey     talked     while     they     played     and \nnaturally,   the   king   was   full   of   his   son's \ngreatness  and  prowess.  \"See  the  glory  of \nmy    son,    Bhuminjaya.    He    has    put    the \nfamed Kaurava warriors to flight.\" \n\"Yes,\"   replied   Yudhishthira   with   a   smile. \n\"Your  son  is  indeed  fortunate  for,  without \nthe   best   of   good   fortune,   how   could   he \nhave    secured    Brihannala    to    drive    his \nchariot?\" \nVirata     was     angry     at     this     persistent \nglorification  of  Brihannala  at  the  expenses \nof  Uttara.  \"Why  do  you,  again  and  again \nbabble about the eunuch?\" he cried.  \n\"While    I    am    talking    about    my    son's \nvictory,  you  expatiate  on  the  charioteering \nskill  of  the  eunuch,  as  if  that  were  of  any \nsignificance.\"     The     king's     anger     only \nincreased   when   Kanka   remonstrated:   \"I \nknow  what  I  am  talking  about.  Brihannala  \n\nis   no   ordinary   person.   The   chariot   she \ndrives  can  never  see  defeat,  and  whoever  \nis    in    it,    is    sure    of    success    in    any \nundertaking, no matter how difficult.\"  \nNow,   this   perverse   flouting   could   not   be \nborne,   and   Virata   in   a   passion   flung   the \ndice   at   Yudhishthira's   face   and   followed \nthis   up   with   a   blow   on   Yudhishthira's \ncheek.   Yudhishthira   was   hurt   and   blood \nflowed down his face. \nSairandhri   who   was   nearby,   wiped   the \nblood  with  the  edge  of  her  garment  and \nsqueezed   it   into   a   golden   cup.   \"Why   all \nthis   fuss?   What   are   you   collecting   the \nblood  into  a  cup  for?\"  demanded  the  angry  \nking, who was still in a passion. \n\"A  Sanyasin's  blood  may  not  be  split  on \nthe   ground,   O   king,\"   replied   Sairandhri. \n\"The   rains   will   fail   in   your   land   for   as \nmany  years  as  there  are  drops  in  the  blood  \nthat  is  split  on  the  earth.  That  was  why  I  \ncollected  the  blood  in  this  cup.  I  fear  you \ndo not know Kanka's greatness.\" \nMeanwhile     the     gatekeeper     announced: \n\"Uttara   and   Brihannala   have   arrived.   The \nprince  is  waiting  for  an  audience  with  the \nking.\"   Virata   got   up   excitedly   and   said: \n\"Ask     him     in,     ask     him in.\"     And \nYudhishthira  whispered  to  the  sentry:  \"Let \nUttara  come  alone.  Brihannala  should  stay \nbehind.\" \nHe  did  this  to  prevent  a  catastrophe,  for  he  \nknew  Arjuna  would  be  unable  to  control \nhis  anger  when  he  saw  the  injury  on  his \nbrother's  face.  He  could  not bear  to  see \nDharmaputra  hurt  by  anyone  except  in  fair  \nbattle.  \nUttara  entered  and  paid  due  homage  to  his  \nroyal    father.    When    he    turned    to    do \nobeisance   to   Kanka   be   was   horrified   to \nsee   his   bleeding   face,   for   now   he   knew \nthat Kanka was the great Yudhishthira. \n\"O   king,\"   he   cried,   \"who   was   it   that \ncaused hurt to this great one?\" \nVirata  looked  at  his  son  and  said:  \"Why \nall   this   fuss   about   it?   I   struck   him   for \nuntimely    and    envious    belittling    of    you \nwhen  I  was  in  an  ocean  of  delight  at  the \nnews  of  your  glorious  victory.  Each  time  I  \nmentioned    you,    this    unlucky    brahmana \nextolled   your   charioteer,   the   eunuch,   and \ngave  the  victory  to  him.  It  was  too  silly \nreally,  and  I  am  sorry  I  struck  him,  but  it  \nis not worth talking about.\"  \nUttara  was  overwhelmed  with  fear.  \"Alas! \nYou   have   done   great   wrong.   Fall   at   his \nfeet      right      now,      father,      and      pray \nforforgiveness   or   we   will   be   destroyed, \nroot and branch.\" \nVirata,  to  whom  all  this  was  inexplicable, \nstood   with   a   puzzled   frown   not   knowing \nwhat  to  do.  But  Uttara  was  so  anxious  and  \nimportunate  that  he  yielded  and  bowed  to  \nYudhishthira asking for pardon. \nThereafter,  embracing  his  son  and  making \nhim   sit,   Virata   said:   \"My   boy,   you   are \ntruly  a  hero.  I  am  in  a  fever  of  impatience  \nto  hear  all  about  it.  How  did  you  defeat \nthe  Kaurava  army?  How did  you  recover  \nthe kine?\"  \nUttara  hung  his  head  down.  \"I  conquered \nno  army,\"  he  said,  \"and  rescued  no  cows.  \nAll  that  was  the  work  of  a  god  prince.  He  \ntook   up   our   cause,   rescued   me   from \ndestruction,   put   the   Kaurava   soldiers   to \nflight   and   brought   the   herd   back.   I   did \nnothing.\"  \nThe   king   could   hardly   believe   his   ears. \n\"Where  is  that  god  prince?\"  he  asked.  \"I \nmust  see  and  thank  the  hero  who  rescued  \nmy  son  and  beat  back  my  foes.  I  will  give  \nmy   daughter,   Uttara,   in   marriage   to   him. \nGo and fetch him in.\" \n\"He   has disappeared  for  the  time  being,\" \nreplied   the   prince,   \"but   I   think   he   will \ncome   again   either   today   or   tomorrow.\" \nUttara   spoke   thus   because   Arjuna   was \nindeed  a  prince  of  the  gods  and  had  also  \nfor     the     time     being     disappeared     in \nBrihannala. \nIn    Virata's    hall    of assembly,    all    the \nleading   citizens   had   gathered   to   celebrate \n\nthe  king's  victory  and  the  prince's.  Kanka,  \nValala    the    cook,    Brihannala,    Tantripala \nand  Dharmagranthi,  who  were  responsible \nfor  the  victories,  arrived  also  and  entering \nthe   hall,   to   the   surprise of  everyone,  sat \namong the princes unbid.  \nSome   explained   the   conduct   by   saying \nthat,   after   all,   these   humbler   folk   had \nrendered   invaluable   service   at   a   critical \ntime and really deserved recognition. \nVirata  entered  the  court.  On  seeing  Kanka  \nsanyasin   and   the   cook   and   the   others \nseated  in  places  reserved  for  princess  and  \nthe   nobility   the   king   lost   his   temper   and \ngave loud vent to his displeasure.  \nWhen  they  felt  they  had  enough  fun,  the \nPandavas   disclosed   their   identity   to   the \namazement    of    all    present.    Virata    was \nbeside  himself  with  joy  to  think  that  it  was  \nthe  Pandava  princes  and  Panchali  who  had  \nbeen   ministering   to   him   all   these   days   in \ndisguise.      He      embraced      Kanka      in \nexuberant   gratitude   and   made   a   formal \nsurrender   of   his   kingdom   and   his   all   to \nhim,     of     course     immediately     receiving \nthem    back    with    thanks.    Virata    also \ninsisted  that  he  should  give  his  daughter  in \nmarriage to Arjuna. \nBut  Arjuna  said:  \"No,  that  would  not  be \nproper,  for  the  princess  learnt  dancing  and  \nmusic  from  me.  I,  as  her  teacher,  am  in \nthe    position    of    father    to    her.\"    He, \nhowever,  agreed  to  accept  her  for  his  son \nAbhimanyu. \nMeanwhile,     envoys     arrived     from     the \nwicked   and   treacherous   Duryodhana   with \na   message   for   Yudhishthira.   \"O   son   of \nKunti,\"  they  said,  \"Duryodhana  feels  very \nsorry   that   owing   to   the   hasty   action   of \nDhananjaya,  you  have  to  go  back  to  the \nwoods  again.  He  let  himself  be  recognised  \nbefore  the  end  of  the  thirteenth  year  and \nso,   in   accordance   with   your   undertaking, \nyou  have  to  dwell  in  the  forest  for  another  \ntwelve years.\"  \nDharmaputra         laughed        and        said: \n\"Messengers,         return         quickly         to \nDuryodhana  and  tell  him  to  make  further \ninquiry.     The     venerable     Bhishma     and \nothers   learned   in   the   stars   will   no   doubt \ntell   him   that   full   thirteen   years   had   been \ncompleted  before  your  forces  heard  again \nthe  twang  of  Dhananjaya's  bow  and  fled  in  \nfear.\"  \n",

From  there,  they  sent \nemissaries   to   summon   their   friends   and \nrelatives.  \nFrom     Dwaraka     came     Balarama     and \nKrishna  with  Arjuna’s  wife  Subhadra,  and \nher  son,  Abhimanyu  and  accompanied  by \nmany   Yadava   warriors.   Loud   and   long \nwas   the   blare   of   trumpet-conchs   as   the \nMatsya   prince   and   the   Pandavas   went \nforth to receive Janardana.  \nIndrasena  and  many  others  like  him,  who \nhad  at  the  beginning  of  the  preceding  year  \nleft   the   Pandavas   in   the   forest,   rejoined \nthem    with    their    chariots   at   Upaplavya. \nThe  Kasi  prince  and  Saibya  ruler  arrived \nwith their forces.  \nDrupada,   the   Panchala   prince,   was   there \ntoo    with    three    divisions,    bringing    with \nhim   Sikhandin   and   Draupadi's   sons   and \nher   brother   Dhrishtadyumna.   There   were \nmany       other       princes       gathered       at \nUpaplavya, well attached to the Pandavas, \nAbhimanyu's   marriage   to   princess   Uttara \nwas   solemnized   according   to   Vedic   rites \nbefore   that   illustrious   gathering   of   friendly \nheroes.   The   wedding   celebrations   over, \nthey   met   in   conclave   in   Virata's   hall   of \nassembly.  \nKrishna    sat    next    to    Yudhishthira    and \nVirata,   while   Balarama   and   Satyaki   were \n\nseated  beside  Drupada.  As  the  bustle  died  \ndown,   all   eyes   were   turned   on   Krishna, \nwho now rose to speak.  \n\"You    all    know,\"    said    Krishna    to    the \nhushed   assembly,   \"the   story   of   the   great \ndeceit   how   Yudhishthira   was   cheated   at \nthe    game    board    and    deprived    of    his \nkingdom  and  exiled  with  his  brothers  and \nDraupadi  to  the  forest.  For  thirteen  years,  \nthe   sons   of   Pandu   have   patiently   borne \ntheir     trouble     in     redemption     of     their \npledged  word.

He  wishes  nothing  but  \ngood   even   to   the   sons   of   Dhritarashtra \nwho   deceived   him   and   did   him   grievous \nwrong.   In   giving   your   counsel,   bear   in \nmind    the    fraud    and    meanness    of    the \nKauravas     as     well     as     the     honorable \nmagnanimity   of   the   Pandavas.   Devise   a \njust  and  honorable  settlement.  We  do  not \nknow  what  Duryodhana  has  in  his  mind.  I  \nfeel  we  should  send  an  able  and  upright \nemissary   to   him   to   persuade   him   to   a \npeaceful   settlement   by   the   restoration   of \nhalf the kingdom to Yudhishthira.\" \nBalarama     then     rose     to     address     the \ngathering.  \"You  have  just  heard  Krishna,\" \nhe   said.   \"The   solution   he   propounds   is \nwise  and  just.  I  endorse  it  as  good  for  both  \nDuryodhana   and   Dharmaputra.   If   Kunti's \nsons   can   get   back   their   kingdom   by   a \npeaceful    settlement,    nothing    could    be \nbetter  for  them,  the  Kauravas  and  for  all \nconcerned.     Only     then     will     there     be \nhappiness  and  peace  in  the  land.  Someone  \nhas    to    go    to    convey    to    Duryodhana \nYudhishthira's      wish      for      a      peaceful \nsettlement  and  bring  an  answer  from  him, \na  man  who  has  the  weight  and  the  ability \nto      bring      about      peace      and      good \nunderstanding.   The   envoy   should   get   the \ncooperation     of     Bhishma,     Dhritarashtra, \nDrona  and  Vidura,  Kripa  and  Aswatthama  \nand  even  of  Karna  and  Sakuni  if  possible,  \nand   secure   support   for   Kunti's   sons.

Dharmaputra,  with  full \nknowledge   of   consequences,   staked   his \nkingdom       and       lost       it,       obstinately \ndisregarding     the     reasoning     of     friends. \nFully  aware  that  he  was  no  match  for  the  \nadept   Sakuni,   he   yet   played   against   him. \nHe   cannot   now   complain   but   can   only \nsupplicate    for his    rights.    A    fit    envoy \nwould  be  one  who  is  not  a  warmonger  but  \nis  dead  set,  in  spite  of  every  difficulty,  on \nachieving  a  peaceful  settlement.  Princes,  I \ndesire     you     to     approach     Duryodhana \ntactfully  and  make  peace  with  him.  Let  us  \navoid  an  armed  conflict  by  all  the  means \nin  our  power.  Only  that  which  accrues  in \npeace  is  worth  while.  Out  of  war,  nothing \nbut wrong can issue.\" \nBalarama's   position   was   that   Yudhishthira \nknew    what    he    was    doing    when    he \ngambled  away  his  kingdom  and  could  not \nnow claim it as of right.  \nThe   fulfilment   of   the   conditions   of   exile \ncould     only     give     the     Pandavas     their \npersonal   freedom   and   not   their   kingdom, \nthat  is  to  say,  they  need  not  serve  another  \nterm   of   exile   in   the   forest.   But   it   gave \nthem    no    right    to    the    return    of    their \nkingdom.  \nDharmaputra  could  only  supplicate  for  the \nreturn  of  what  he  had  lost  and  not  claim  it  \nas   of   right.   Balarama   did   not   relish   an \narmed  conflict  among  scions  of  the  same \nfamily   and   rightly   held   that   war   would \nlead only to disaster. \nThe     poet     puts     an     eternal     truth     in \nBalarama's mouth.  \nSatyaki,   the   Yadava   warrior,   who   heard \nBalarama   speak   thus,   could   not   contain \nhimself.    He    rose    in    anger    and    spoke \nindignantly: \n\"Balarama's  words  do  not  strike  me  as  in \nthe   least   degree   just.   One   can,   if   skilful \n\nenough,  make  out  a  plausible  plea  for  any  \ncase,  but  not  all  the  skill  in  the  world  can \nconvert   wrong   into   right   or   injustice   into \njustice.   I   must   protest   against   Balarama's \nstand,  which  fills  me  with  disgust.  Do  we \nnot   see   in   one   and   the   same   tree,   one \nbranch    bowed    with    fruit    and    another \nsticking   out   gaunt   and   useless?   So,   of \nthese  brothers,  Krishna  speaks  words  that  \nbreathe     the     spirit     of     dharma     while \nBalarama's   attitude   is   unworthy.   And   if \nyou  grant  what  cannot  be  doubted  that  the  \nKauravas    cheated    Yudhishthira    of    his \nshare  of  the  kingdom,  why  then,  allowing \nthem  to  keep  it  is  as  unjust  as  confirming \na   thief   in   the   possession   of   his   booty! \nAnyone,        who        finds        fault        with \nDharmaputra,  does  so  in  cowardly  fear  of \nDuryodhana,  not  for  any  sound  reason.  O  \nprinces,  forgive  my  harsh  speech. Not  of \nhis  own  volition  but  because  the  Kauravas  \npressed  and  invited  him  to  do  so,  did  the  \nnovice    and    unwilling    Dharmaputra    play \nwith   a   dishonest   gambler   that   game   so \nfraught  with  disaster.  Why  should  he  bow \nand   supplicate   before   Duryodhana,   now \nthat      he      has     fulfilled     his     pledges? \nYudhishthira  is  not  a  mendicant  and  need \nnot  beg.  He  has  kept  his  word  and  so  have  \nhis   brothers   twelve   years   in   exile   in   the \nforest   and   twelve   months   there   after   in \ndisguise   according   to   their   pledge.   And \nyet,  Duryodhana  and  his  associates,  most \nshamelessly   and   dishonestly,   question   the \nperformance.  I  shall  defeat  these  impudent  \nvillains  in  battle  and  they  shall  either  seek \nYudhishthira's  pardon  or  meet  their  doom.  \nHow  can  a  righteous  war  be  wrong  in  any  \ncase?   There   is   no   sin   in   slaying  enemies \nwho  take  up  arms  and  fight.  To  supplicate  \nbefore  the  enemy,  is  to  incur  disgrace.  If \nDuryodhana   desires   war,   he   can   have   it \nand   we   shall   be   quite   ready   for   it.   Let \nthere  be  no  delay  and  let  us  get  on  with \nthe  preparations.  Duryodhana  is  not  going \nto  part  with  territory  without  a  war  and  it  \nwould be folly to waste time.\"  \nDrupada's     heart     was     gladdened     by \nSatyaki's  resolute  words.  He  rose  and  said:  \n\"Satyaki  is  right  and  I  support  him.  Soft \nwords  will  not  bring  Duryodhana  round  to  \nreason.   Let   us   continue   our   preparations \nfor   war   and   let   our   friends   be   warned \nwithout   loss   of   time   to   bring   up   their \nforces.    Send    word    instantly    to    Salya, \nDhrishtaketu,   Jayatsena   and   Kekaya.   We \nmust,  of  course,  send  a  suitable  envoy  to \nDhritarashtra.  The  learned  brahmana,  who \nconducts   the   religious   ceremonies   in   my \ncourt,   can   be   sent   to   Hastinapura,   with \nconfidence.   Instruct   him   well   as   to   what \nhe  should  say  to  Duryodhana  and  how  he  \nshould   convey   the   message   to   Bhishma, \nDhritarashtra and Dronacharya.\" \nWhen     Drupada     concluded,     Vasudeva \n(Krishna,  the  son  of  Vasudeva)  rose  and \naddressing Drupada, said: \n\"What  you  suggest  is  practicable  and  also \nconforms   to   the   kingly   code.   Baladeva \nand  I  are  bound  to  the  Kauravas  and  the  \nPandavas  with  equal  ties  of  affection.  We \ncame   here   for   princess   Uttara's   wedding \nand  will  return  now  to  our  city.  Great  are  \nyou  among  the  princes  of  the  land,  alike  in  \nage  and  wisdom,  and  entitled  to  advise  us  \nall.    Dhritarashtra    too    holds    you,    his \nboyhood    friends,    in    high    esteem    like \nDrona  and  Kripa.  It  is  therefore  only  right  \nthat    you    should    instruct    the    brahmana \nenvoy  on  his  mission  of  peace.  If  he  fails \nto  persuade  Duryodhana  out  of  his  error, \nprepare    for    the    inevitable    conflict,    my \nfriends, and send word to us.\"  \nThe  conference  ended  and  Krishna  left  for  \nDwaraka   with   his   people.   The   Pandavas \nand    their    allies    went    on    with    their \npreparations.  Messengers  went  forth  to  all \nthe   friendly   princes   who   got   busy   and \nmobilised their respective armies. \nMeanwhile,   Duryodhana   and   his   brothers \nwere  not  idle.  They  also  began  preparing \n\nfor  the  coming  conflict  and  sent  word  to \ntheir  friends  to  get  their  contingents  ready \nfor war.  \nNews  of  these  preparations  on  both  sides  \nsoon   spread   through   out   the   land.   \"The \nconstant   rapid   journeying   back   and   forth \nof  princes  caused  a  great  stir  everywhere.  \nThe  earth  shook  beneath  the  heavy  tramp \nof marching legions,\" says the poet. \nIt  would  appear  that  even  in  olden  days, \nmilitary   preparations   were   made   in   much \nthe same way as in our times.  \nDrupada  called  in  his  brahmana  and  said \nto  him:  \"You  know  Duryodhana's  bent  of \nmind    as    well    as    the    qualities    of    the \nPandavas.  Go  to  him  as  the  emissary  of \nthe  Pandavas.  The  Kauravas  deceived  the \nPandavas    with    the    connivance    of    their \nfather   Dhritarashtra   who   would   not   listen \nto   the   sage   advice   of   Vidura.   Show  the \nold,  weak  king,  who  is  misled  by  his  son,  \nthe  path  of  dharma  and  wisdom.  You  will \nfind   in   Vidura   a   great   ally   in   this   task. \nYour   mission   may   lead   to   differences   of \nopinion   among   the   elder   statesmen   such \nas  Bhishma,  Drona  and  Kripa  as  well  as \namong  the  warlords.  And,  if  this  happens,  \nit    will    be    some    time    before    those \ndifferences   are   smoothed   out,   which   will \nbe  time  gained  for  the  completion  of  the \nPandavas   war   preparations.   As   long   as \nyou  are  in  Duryodhana's  capital  talking  of \npeace,    their    preparations    for    war    will \nreceive  a  set-back  which  is  all  to  the  good  \nfrom   the   Pandavas'   standpoint.   If,   by   a \nmiracle,  you  are  able  to  come  back  with \ngood  terms  of  peace,  so  much  the  better.  I  \ndo  not  expect  Duryodhana  will  agree  to  a  \npeaceful  settlement.  Still,  to  send  one  on  a  \npeace   mission   will   be   advantageous   to \nus.\"  \nIn   December   1941,   the   Japanese   were \ncarrying      on      negotiations      with      the \nAmericans     and,     immediately     on     the \nbreakdown    of    those    talks,    took    them \nunawares    and    attacked    Pearl    Harbor \ndestroying their naval forces there.  \nDrupada's    instruction    to    the    brahmana \nwould    show    that    this    was    no    new \ntechnique.  And  that,  even  in  the  old  days,  \nthe  same  method  was  followed  of  carrying \non      negotiations      and      even      sincerely \nworking    for    peace,    but    simultaneously \npreparing,     with     unremitting     vigor,     for \noutbreak   of   war   and   carrying   on   peace \ntalks  with  the  object  of  creating  dissension \nin   the   enemy's   ranks.   There   is   nothing \nnew under the sun! \n",

To   Dwaraka,   Arjuna \nwent himself. \nHaving   understood   through   his   spies   the \nturn   events   were   taking,   Duryodhana  too \ndid     not     remain     idle.     Learning     that \nVasudeva  (Krishna)  was  back  in  his  home  \ncity,   he   sped   towards   Dwaraka   in   his \nchariot,  as  fast  as  his  swiftest  horses  could  \ntake   him.   The   two   of   them,   Arjuna   and \nDuryodhana,  thus  reached  Dwaraka  on  the  \nsame day.  \nKrishna   was   fast   asleep.   Because   they \nwere    his    close    relatives,    Arjuna    and \nDuryodhana   could   go   into   his   bedroom. \nThere   they   both   waited   for   Krishna   to \nwake  up.  Duryodhana,  who  went  in  first, \nseated  himself  on  a  decorated  throne-chair \nat  the  head  of  the  bed,  while  Arjuna  kept  \nstanding   at   its   foot   with   arms   folded   in \nrespectful posture.  \nWhen  Mahadeva  woke  up,  his  eyes  fell  on  \nArjuna  who  stood  in  front  of  him  and  he \ngave  him  warm  welcome.  Turning  then  to \nDuryodhana,   he   welcomed   him   too   and \nasked   them   what   brought   them   both   to \nDwaraka.   Duryodhana   was   the   first   to \nspeak.  \n\n\"It  looks,\"  said  he,  \"as  though  war  would \nbreak  out  between  us  soon.  If  it  does,  you  \nmust  support  me.  Arjuna  and  I  are  equally  \nbeloved   of   you.   We   both   claim   equally \nclose   relationship   with   you.   You   cannot \nsay  that  either  of  us  is  nearer  to  you  than \nthe   other.   I   came   here   before   Arjuna. \nTradition   has   it   that   he   who   came   first \nshould   be   shown   preference.   Janardana, \nyou  are  the  greatest  among  the  great;  so  it  \nis  incumbent  on  you  to  set  an  example  to  \nothers.   Confirm   with   your   conduct   the \ntraditional   dharma   and   remember   that   it \nwas I who came first.\" \nTo       which       Purushottama       (Krishna) \nanswered:  \"Son  of  Dhritarashtra,  it  may  be  \nthat  you  came  here  first,  but  it  was  Kunti's  \nson  that  I  saw  immediately  on  waking  up.  \nIf  you  were  the  first  arrival,  it  was  Arjuna  \nwho  first  caught  my  eye.  So,  even  in  this \nrespect,  your  claims  on  me  are  equal  and  I  \nam  therefore  bound  to  render  assistance  to  \nboth    sides.    In    distributing    favors,    the \ntraditional    usage    is    to    begin    with    the \njunior-most  among  the  recipients.  I  would,  \ntherefore,  offer  the  choice  to  Arjuna  first. \nThe    Narayana,    my    tribesmen,    are    my \nequals  in  battle  and  constitute  a  host,  large  \nand   almost   invincible.   In   my   distribution \nof  assistance,  they  will  be  on  one  side,  and \nI   individually   on   the   other.   But   I   shall \nwield   no   weapon   and   take   no   part   in \nactual fighting.\"  \nTurning   to   Arjuna   he   said,   \"Partha,   think \nit   over   well.   Would   you   want   me,   alone \nand  weaponless,  or  would  you  prefer  the \nprowess   of   the   Narayana?   Exercise   the \nright   to   the   first   choice   which   custom \ngives you as the younger man.\" \nScarcely     had     Krishna     finished     when \nArjuna   said   with   reverence   and   without \nhesitation:  \"I  would  be  content  if  you  are \nwith    us,    though    you    may    wield    no \nweapon.\"  \nDuryodhana   could   hardly   contain   himself \nfor  joy  at  what  he  thought  was  Arjuna's \nimbecile  choice.  He  gladly  chose  the  help \nof   Vasudevas   army   and   his   request   was \ngranted.  Pleased  with  the  acquisition  of  a \nmighty     force,     Duryodhana     went     to \nBaladeva and told him the story.  \nAs    he    finished    speaking,    the    mighty \nBalarama    said:    \"Duryodhana,    they    must \nhave  told  you  all  I  said  at  the  time  of  the  \nmarriage   of   Virata's   daughter.   I   pleaded \nyour  case  and  urged  everything  that  could  \nbe  said  for  you.  Often  have  I  told  Krishna  \nthat  we  have  equal  ties  with  the  Kauravas  \nand  the  Pandavas.  But  my  words  failed  to  \ncarry  conviction  to  him.  I  am  helpless.  It \nis   impossible   for   me   to   side   with   one \nwhom   Krishna   opposes.   I   will   not   help \nPartha   and   I   cannot   support   you   against \nKrishna.   Duryodhana,   you   come   of   an \nillustrious   line,   which   is   respected   by   all \nthe   princes   of   the   land.   Well,   then,   if   it \nmust  be  war,  bear  yourself  in  accordance \nwith the Kshatriya code,\" said he. \nDuryodhana    returned    to    Hastinapura    in \nhigh   spirits   saying   to   himself:   \"Arjuna   has \nmade  a  fool of  himself.  The  great  army  of  \nDwaraka    will    fight    on    my    side    and \nBalarama's  good  wishes  too  are  with  me. \nVasudeva has been left without an army.\"  \n\"Dhananjaya,   why   did   you   choose   thus \nunwisely,      preferring      me      alone      and \nunarmed  to  my  fully  equipped  and  heroic \nforces?\"  asked  Krishna  of  Arjuna  with  a \nsmile,    when    they    were    alone.    Arjuna \nanswered:  \n\"My  ambition  is  to  achieve  glory  even  like  \nyours.  You  have  the  power  and  prowess  to  \nface  all  the  princes  of  the  land  and  their \nhordes  in  battle  single-handed.  I  too  feel  I  \ncan  do  it.  So,  I  desire  that  I  should  win  the  \nbattle     with     you     driving     my     chariot \nunarmed.  I  have  desired  this  for  long  and \nyou have today fulfilled my wish.\"  \nVasudeva   smiled   again   and   pronounced \nthis     benediction:     \"Are     you     trying     to \ncompete  with  me?  May  you  succeed,\"  for  \nhe   was   pleased   with   Arjuna's   decision. \n\nThis   is   the   sacred   story   of   how   Krishna \nbecame Partha's charioteer. \n",

      "content": "\nSALYA,  the  ruler  of  Madradesa,  was  the  \nbrother   of   Madri,   the   mother   of   Nakula \nand  Sahadeva.  He  heard  that  the  Pandavas  \nwere   camping   in   the   city   of   Upaplavya \nand making preparations for war.  \nHe  collected  a  very  big  army  and  set  off \ntowards   that   city   to   join   the   Pandavas. \nSalya's   army   was   so   large   that   where   it \nhalted  for  rest,  the  encampment  extended \nover a length of nearly fifteen miles.  \nNews   of   Salya   and   his   marching   forces \nreached   Duryodhana.   Deciding   that   Salya \nshould  somehow  be  persuaded  to  join  his \nside,  Duryodhana  instructed  his  officers  to \nprovide   him   and   his   great   army   with   all \nfacilities    and    treat    them    to    sumptuous \nhospitality.  \nIn       accordance       with       Duryodhana's \ninstruction,    several    beautifully    decorated \nrest  houses  were  erected  at  several  places  \non  the  route,  at  which  Salya  and  his  men \nwere    treated    to    wondrous    hospitality. \nFood and drink were lavishly provided.  \nSalya   was   exceedingly   pleased   with   the \nattentions  paid  to  him  but  assumed  that  his  \nnephew,    Yudhishthira,    had    arranged    all \nthis.   Salya's   army   marched   on,   the   earth \nshaking beneath their heavy strides.  \nFeeling   very   pleased   with   the   hospitality, \nhe   called   the   waiting   attendants   one   day \nand said to them: \n\"I  must  reward  you  all  who  have  treated \nme   and   my   soldiers   with   so   much   love \nand  attention.  Please  tell  Kunti's  son  that \nhe  should  let  me  do  this,  and  bring  me  his  \nconsent.\" \nThe   servants   went  and  told  their  master, \nDuryodhana,   this.   Duryodhana,   who   was \nall   the   time   moving   unobserved   with   the \nparty  waiting  on  Salya  and  his  soldiers,  at  \nonce    took    this    opportunity    to    present \nhimself     before     Salya,     and     say     how \nhonored   he   felt   at   Salya's   acceptance of \nthe Kaurava hospitality.  \nThis  amazed  Salya  whom  till  then  had  no \nsuspicion   of   the   truth,   and   he   was   also \ntouched  by  the  chivalry  of  Duryodhana  in \nlavishing   kingly   hospitality   on   a   partisan \nof the Pandavas. \nGreatly  moved,  he  exclaimed,  \"How  noble  \nand kind of you! How can I repay you?\"  \nDuryodhana  replied:  \"You  and  your  forces  \nshould    fight    on    my    side.    This    is    the \nreward I ask of you.\" \nSalya was stunned. \nThe    Puranas    wherein    right    conduct    is \nalways     preached,     sometimes     set     out \nstories      in      which      conduct,      not      in \nconformity        with        Dharma,        seems \ncondoned.   Is   it   right,   one   may   ask,   for \nreligious   books   thus   to   seem   to   justify \nwrong?  \nA   little   reflection   will   enable   one   to   see \nthe  matter  in  proper  light.  It  is  necessary \nto   bring   home   the   fact   that   even   wise, \ngood  and  great  men  are  liable  to  fall  into  \nerror.  \nThat   is   why   the   Puranas,   although   ever \nseeking      to      instil      Dharma,      contain \nnarratives  to  show  how  in  this  world  even \ngood     people     sometimes     sin     against \nDharma,   as   though   irresistibly   driven   to \ndo so.  \nThis    is    to    press home   the   truth   that \nhowsoever   learned   one   may   be,   humility \nand     constant     vigilance     are     absolutely \nnecessary if one wishes to avoid evil. \nWhy  indeed,  did  the  great  authors  of  our \nepics   write   about   the   lapses   of   Rama   in \nthe    Ramayana    and    Yudhishthira    in    the \nMahabharata? \nWhere  was  the  need  to  make  mention  of \nthem  and  then  labor  arguments  to  explain \nthem     away,     thereby     disturbing     men's \nminds?  \nIt  was  not  as  though  others  had  discovered  \nthe  lapses  and  Vyasa  and  Valmiki  had  to \ndefend  their  heroes.  The  stories  are  artistic \n\ncreations  in  which  lapses  they  impress  the \ndesired moral. \nThe   parts   dealing   with   the   lapses   deeply \ndistress   the   reader's   mind   and   serve   as \nsolemn  warnings  of  pitfalls,  which  wait  to \nengulf the careless.  \nThey   dispose   the   mind   to   humility   and \nwatchfulness  and  make  it  realise  the  need \nfor   divine   guidance.   The   modern   cinema \nalso  projects  on  the  screen  much  that  is \nbad and immoral.  \nWhatever  may  be  the  explanation  offered \nby  the  protagonists  of  the  cinema,  evil  is \npresented   on   the   screen   in   an   attractive \nfashion    that    grips    people's    minds    and \ntempts them into the path of wickedness.  \nThis   is   not   so   in   the   Puranas.   Although \nthey  do  point  out  that  even  great  men  now  \nand   again   fell   into   error   and   committed \nwrong,  the  presentation  is  such  as  to  warn \nthe  reader  and  not  to  allure  him  into  evil \nways.  \nThis  is  the  striking  difference  between  our \nepics  and  the  modern  talkies,  which  arises  \nfrom  the  difference  in  the  character  of  the  \npeople who produced them.  \n\"You  are  the  same  unto  us  both.  I  must \nmean   as   much   to   you   as   the   Pandavas. \nYou  must  agree  to  come  to  my  aid,\"  said  \nDuryodhana. \nSalya   answered:   \"Be   it   so.\"   Flattered   by \nDuryodhana's    splendid    reception,    Salya \ndeserted  the  Pandavas  who  were  entitled \nto   his   love   and   esteem   and   pledged   his \nword  to  fight  on  Duryodhana's  side  which \nshows  what  dangers  may  lurk  in  receiving \nthe hospitality of kings. \nFeeling   that   it   would   not   be   right   to   go \nback   without   meeting   Yudhishthira,   Salya \nthen     turned     to     Duryodhana     saying: \n\"Duryodhana,   believe   me.   I   have   given \nyou   my   word   of   honor.  I  must  however \nmeet   Yudhishthira   and   tell   him   what   I \nhave done.\" \n\"Go,  see  him  and  return  soon.  And  do  not  \nforget     your     promise     to     me,\"     said \nDuryodhana.  \n\"Good   luck   to   you.   Go   back   to   your \npalace.  I  will  not  betray  you.\"  Saying  this,  \nSalya  went  to  the  city  of  Upaplavya  where  \nYudhishthira was camping. \nThe  Pandavas  received  the  ruler  of  Madra  \nwith   great   eclat.   Nakula   and   Sahadeva \nwere  joyous  beyond  measure  to  see  their \nuncle  to  whom  the  Pandavas  narrated  all \ntheir hardships and sufferings.  \nWhen  they  started  talking  about  obtaining \nhis   help   in   the   war   that   was   impending, \nSalya   related   to   them   the   story   of   his \npromise to Duryodhana.  \nYudhishthira  saw  at  once  that  it  had  been \na   mistake   to   take   Salya's   assistance   for \ngranted,      thereby      letting      Duryodhana \nforestall them.  \nConcealing   his   disappointment   as   best   he \ncould, Yudhishthira addressed Salya thus: \n\"Great  warrior,  you  are  bound  to  keep  the  \npromise   you   have   made   to,   Duryodhana. \nYou  are  the  equal  of  Vasudeva  in  battle \nand  Karna  will  have  you  as  his  charioteer  \nwhen he    seeks    Arjuna's    life    in    the \nbattlefield.  Are  you  going  to  be  the  cause  \nof   Arjuna's   death?   Or   are   you   going   to \nsave  him  then?  I  know  I  cannot  fairly  ask  \nthis of you. Still I do.\"  \nTo  which  Salya  rejoined:  \"My  lad,  I  have  \nbeen   tricked   into   giving   Duryodhana   my \nword  and  I  shall  be  ranged  against  you  in \nbattle.  But  when  Karna  proceeds  to  attack  \nArjuna,  if  I  happen  to  be  his  charioteer, \nyou   may   take   it   he   will   go   to   battle \ndisheartened   and   Arjuna   shall   be   saved. \nFear  not.  The  sorrows  and  insults,  which \nwere  visited  on  Draupadi  and  you  all,  will \nsoon  be  an  avenged  memory.  Henceforth, \nyours   will   be   good   luck.   No   one   can \nprevent  or  alter  what  has  been  ordained  by  \nfate. I have acted wrongly. Bear with me.\"  \n",

      "content": "\n\nINDRA,   the   Lord   of   the   three   regions, \nwas  once  so  drunk  with  pride  that  he  quite  \nforgot   the   courteous   manners   and   forms \nthat the gods had hitherto observed.  \nWhen   Brihaspati,   preceptor   of   the   gods, \nforemost   in   all   branches   of   learning,   and \nvenerated    alike    by    the    gods    and    the \nasuras,   came   to   his   court, Indra  did  not \nrise  from  his  seat  to  receive  the  acharya  or  \nask  him  to  be  seated  and  failed  to  do  the  \ncustomary honors.  \nIn    his    great    conceit,    Indra    persuaded \nhimself  to  believe  that  the  sastras  allowed \nhim  as  a  king  in  court  the  prerogative  of \nreceiving    guests    seated.    Brihaspati    was \nhurt  by  Indra's  discourtesy  and,  attributing \nit   to   the   arrogance   of   prosperity,   silently \nleft the assembly.  \nWithout   the   high   priest   of   the   gods,   the \ncourt   lost   in   splendor   and   dignity   and \nbecame an unimpressive gathering.  \nIndra  soon  realized  the  foolishness  of  his \nconduct   and,   sensing   trouble   for   himself \nfrom  the  acharya's  displeasure,  he  thought \nto  make  up  with  him  by  falling  at  his  feet  \nand asking for forgiveness.  \nBut    this    he    could    not    do,    because \nBrihaspati  had,  in  his  anger,  made  himself \ninvisible. This preyed on Indra's mind.  \nWith    Brihaspati    gone,    Indra's    strength \nbegan  to  decline,  while  that  of  the  asuras \nincreased,   which   encouraged   the   latter   to \nattack  the  gods.  Then  Brahma,  taking  pity \non  the  beleaguered  gods,  advised  them  to  \ntake unto themselves a new acharya. \nSaid    he    to    them:    \"You    have,    through \nIndra's   folly,   lost   Brihaspati.   Go   now   to \nTwashta's  son  Visvarupa  and  request  that \nnoble  spirit  to  be  your  preceptor  and  all \nwill be well with you.\" \nHeartened    by    these    words,    the    gods \nsought    the    youthful    anchorite    Visvarupa \nand   made   their   request   to   him   saying: \n\"Though   young   in   years,   you   are   well \nversed  in  the  Vedas.  Do  us  the  honor  of \nbeing our teacher.\"  \nVisvarupa  agreed,  to  the  great  advantage \nof  the  gods  for,  as  a  result  of  his  guidance  \nand   teaching,   they   were   saved   from   the \ntormenting asuras. \nVisvarupa's,  mother  was  of  the  asura  clan \nof  daityas,  which  caused  Indra  to  regard \nVisvarupa   with   suspicion.   He   feared   that \nbecause  of  his  birth,  Visvarupa  might  not \nbe  quite  loyal  and  his  suspicion  gradually \ndeepened.  \nApprehending   danger   to   himself   from   this \ndescendent   of   the   enemies   of   the   gods, \nIndra  sought  to  entice  him  into  error  with \nthe  temptresses  of  his  court  and  so  weaken  \nhim    spiritually.    But    Visvarupa    did    not \nsuccumb. \nThe   artful  and  seductive  blandishments  of \nIndra's  glamour  girls  had  no  effect  on  the \nyoung  ascetic.  He  held  fast  to  his  vow  of \ncelibacy.  When  Indra  found  that  his  plan \nof    seduction    failed,    he    gave    way    to \nmurderous   thoughts   and   one   day   killed \nVisvarupa with the Vajrayudha.  \nThe   story   goes   that   the   world   suffers \nvicariously   for   this   great   sin   of   Indra. \nAnd,  as  a  result  of  it,  parts  of  the  earth \nturned  alkaline  and  became  unsuitable  for \ncultivation     and     women     came     to     be \nafflicted   with   the   physical   troubles   and \nuncleanness      peculiar      to      them.      The \nfrothing of water is also attributed to this. \nTwashta   in   his   great   rage   and   grief   at \nIndra's    cruel    killing    of    his    son    and, \ndesirous  of  avenging  his  death,  performed \na  great  sacrifice.  And  out  of  the  sacrificial \nflames     sprang     Indra's     mortal     enemy \nVritra.  \nTwashta  sent  him  against  the  chief  of  the \ngods,   saying:   \"Enemy   of   Indra,   may   you \nbe  strong  and  may  you  kill  Indra.\"  A  great  \nbattle   raged   between   the   two   in   which \nVritra was gaining the upper hand. \nWhen  the  battle  was  going  against  Indra, \nthe   rishis   and   the   gods   sought   refuge   in \ngreat  Vishnu  who  offered  them  protection \nand  said  to  them:  \"Be  not  afraid.  I  shall \n\nenter  Indra's  Vajrayudha  and  he  will  win \nthe  battle  in  the  end.\"  And  they  returned  in  \ngood heart.  \nThey   went   to   Vritra   and said   to   him: \n\"Please  make  friends  with  Indra.  You  are \nboth equal in strength and valor.\"  \nVritra        respectfully        answered:        \"O \nblameless   ones,   how   can   Indra,   and   I \nbecome     friends?     Forgive     me.     There \ncannot   be   friendship   between   rivals   for \nsupremacy.    Two    great    powers    cannot \ncoexist as you know.\" \nThe  rishis  said  in  reply:  \"Do  not  entertain \nsuch   doubts.   Two   good   souls   can   be \nfriends   and   their   friendship   is   often   after \nhostility.\" \nVritra   yielded   saying:   \"Well,   then,   I   shall \ncease   fighting.   But   I   have   no   faith   in \nIndra.  He  might  take  me  unawares.  So  I \nseek  this  boon  of  you,  namely,  that  neither  \nby   day   nor   by   night,   neither   with   dry \nweapons  nor  with  wet  ones,  neither  with \nstone  nor  with  wood,  nor  with  metals,  nor  \nwith  arrows  shall  Indra  be  able  to  take  my  \nlife.\"  \n\"So be it,\" said the rishis and the gods.  \nHostilities  ceased.  But  soon  Vritra's  fears \nwere     confirmed.     Indra     only     feigned \nfriendship  for  Vritra  but  was,  all  the  time, \nwaiting   for   a   suitable   opportunity   to   slay \nhim.  \nOne  evening,  he  met  Vritra  on  the  beach \nand   began   to   attack   him   in   the   twilight. \nThe   battle   had   raged   for   a   long   while \nwhen    Vritra    praising    the    Lord    Vishnu, \nsaid  to  Indra:  \"Meanest  of  the  mean,  why \ndo  you  not  use  the  unfailing  Vajrayudha? \nHallowed  by  Hari,  use  it  against  me  and  I  \nshall attain blessedness through Hari.\"  \nIndra   maimed   Vritra   by   chopping   off   his \nright  arm  but,  undaunted,  the  latter  hurled \nwith   his   left   band,   his   iron   mace   at   his \nassailant    who    thereupon    cut    down    his \nother   arm   also.   When   Indra   disappeared \ninto   the   mouth   of   Vritra,   great   was   the \nconsternation of the gods.  \nBut  Indra  was  not  dead.  He  ripped  Vritra's  \nbelly   open   and   issuing   forth   went   to   the \nnearby      beach.      And      directing      his \nthunderbolt  at  the  water  hurled  it  so  that \nthe  surf  flew  and  hit  Vritra.  Vishnu  having \nentered   the   foam,   it   became   a   deadly \nweapon   and   the   mighty   Vritra   lay   dead. \nThe    long    battle    thus    ended    and    the \nafflicted  world  heaved  a  sigh  of  relief.  But  \nto   Indra   himself,   the   end   of   the   war \nbrought     only     ignominy     because     his \nvictory  was  secured  through  sin  and  deceit  \nand is went into hiding for sheer shame.  \nIndra's  disappearance  caused  the  gods  and  \nthe   rishis   great   distress.   For   a   people \nwithout   a   king   or   a   council   of   state   to \ngovern  them  cannot  prosper.  So  they  went  \nto  the  good  and  mighty  king  Nahusha  and  \noffered him the crown.  \n\"Forgive  me,  I  cannot  be  your  king.  Who  \nam  I  to  aspire  to  the  seat  of  Indra?  How \ncan   I   protect   you?   It   is   impossible,\"   he \nhumbly     objected.     But     they     insisted, \nsaying:  \"Do  not  hesitate.  Be  anointed  our \nking.   All   the   merit   and   potency   of   our \npenance  will  be  yours  and  be  an  addition \nto    your    strength.    The    power    and    the \nenergy  of  everyone  you  set  your  eyes  on \nshall  be  transferred  to  you  and  you  will  be  \ninvincible.\"       Thus       over-powered,      he \nagreed.   Revolution   is   no   new   thing.   This \nstory  shows  that,  even  in  the  world  of  the  \ngods,   there   was   a   revolution   leading   to \nIndra's      dethronement      and      Nahusha's \ninstallation  as  king  in  his  stead.  The  story \nof Nahusha's fall is also instructive.  \n",

Nahusha \nbecame  the  king  of  the  gods  in  his  stead.  \nNahusha  started  well,  assisted  by  the  merit  \nand  the  fame  earned  by  him  while  he  was  \na  king  on  earth.

One  day,  he  saw \nIndra's  wife  and  became  enamored  of  her.  \nPossessed   by   evil   thoughts,   he   spoke   in \ntones of command to the assembled gods: \n\"Why   has   not   Sachidevi,   the   wife   of   the \nking  of  the  gods,  come  to  me?  Am  I  not  \nthe  king  of  the  gods  now?  Send  her  to  my  \nhouse soon.\"  \nWhen   she   learnt   this,   Indra's   wife   was \nindignant.  In  fear  and  distress,  she  went  to  \nBrihaspati  and  cried  out:  \"Preceptor,  save \nme from this wicked person.\"  \nBrihaspati   offered   her   protection.   \"Fear \nnot  \"  he  said,  \"Indra  will  soon  be  back. \nStay  here  with  me.  You  will  regain  your \nhusband.\"     When     Nahusha     learnt     that \nSachidevi  did  not  agree  to  fall  in  with  his \nwishes  and  that  she  sought  and  obtained \nshelter  under  Brihaspati's  roof,  he  became \nexceedingly angry.  \nThe     king's     displeasure     frightened     the \ngods.  They  protested:  \"King  of  the  gods, \nbe   not   angry.   Your   anger   will   make   the \nworld  sad.  Sachidevi  is  another's  wife,  do  \nnot   covet   her.   Do   not   swerve   from   the \npath of righteousness.\" \nBut,   the   infatuated   Nahusha   would   not \nlisten    to    them.    Tauntingly,    he    said    to \nthem:    \"When    Indra    lusted    for    Ahalya, \nwhere were       your       principles       of \nrighteousness  and  good  conduct?  Why  did  \nyou  not  prevent  him  then  and  why  do  you \nstop  me  now?  What  did  you  do  when  he  \nso   shamelessly   murdered   Visvarupa   when \nthe  latter  was  in  penance  and  where  was \nyour  virtuous  horror  when  he  killed Vritra \nthrough  deceit?  Sachidevi's  only  course  is \nto  come  and  live  with  me  and  it  will  be  for  \nyour   good   to   get   her   reconciled   to   my \nproposal  and  leave  her  in  my  charge.  So,  \nnow set about it,\" ordered Nahusha.  \nThe   affrighted   gods   decided   to   talk   the \nmatter  over  with  Brihaspati  and  somehow \ncontrive   to   bring   Sachidevi   to   Nahusha. \nThey  all  went  to  Brihaspati  and  related  to  \nhim  what  Nahusha  had  said  and  pleaded \nthat  Sachidevi  should  submit  to  Nahusha’s  \ndesires.  \nAt  which,  the  chaste  Sachidevi  shook  with \nshame  and  fear  and  cried  out:  \"My  God!  I  \ncannot  do  it.  I  sought  refuge  in  you.  Oh \nbrahmana, do protect me.\" \nBrihaspati   consoled   her   and   said:   \"He, \nwho  betrays  one  who  has  sought  refuge, \nwill  meet  with  destruction.  The  very  earth \nwill  not  let  the  seed,  that  he  sows,  sprout.  \nI  will  not  give  you  up.  Nahusha's  end  is \napproaching. Be not afraid.\"  \nHe   indicated   a   way   of   escape   from   her \ndifficult     situation     by     hinting     that     she \nshould   pray   for   time,   and   the   shrewd \nSachidevi  took  the  hint  and  bravely  went \nto Nahusha's palace. \nAs  soon  as  Nahusha  saw  her,  pride  and \nlust  having  deprived  him  of  his  senses,  he \nwas  beside  himself  with  joy  and  said:  \"O \nfair  one,  do  not  tremble.  I  am  the  lord  of \nthe  three  regions.  There  can  be  no  sin  in \nyour becoming my wife.\"  \nHearing    the    wicked    man's    words,    the \nvirtuous  Indrani,  Indra's  wife,  trembled  for \na  moment.  Soon  regaining  composure  she \nreplied:    \"King    of    the    gods,    before    I \nbecome  yours,  I  have  a  request  to  make.  Is  \nIndra  alive  or  is  he  dead?  If  he  is  alive, \nwhere   is   he?   If,   after   making   enquiries \nand  searching  for  him,  I  do  not  find  him, \nthen  no  sin  will  attach  to  me  and  I  could  \nbecome      your      wife      with      a      clear \nconscience.\"  \nNahusha  said:  \"What  you  say  is  right.  Go  \nand  search  for  him  and  be  sure  to  return.  \nRemember    the    plighted    word.\"    Saying \nthis,    he    sent    her    back    to    Brihaspati's \nhouse.  \n\nThe   gods   went   to   the   great   Vishnu   and \ncomplained  to  him  of  Nahusha.  They  said: \n\"Lord,  it  was  your  might  that  killed  Vritra  \nbut  Indra  bears,  the  sin  of  it,  and  ashamed  \nand  afraid  to  show  himself  in  his  unclean \nstate, he has hidden himself.  \nPray   indicate   a   way   of   deliverance   for \nhim.\"   Narayana   said   in   reply:   \"Let   him \nworship   me.   He   will   be   cleansed   of   sin \nand   the   evil-minded   Nahusha   will   meet \nwith destruction.\" \nSachidevi    prayed    to    the    goddess    of \nchastity,  and,  by  her  grace,  reached  where  \nIndra   was   in   hiding.   Indra   had   reduced \nhimself   to   the   size   of   an   atom   and   hid \nhimself   in   a   fibre   of   the   stem   of   a   lotus \nplant   growing   in   Manasarovara.   He   was \ndoing   penance   in   that   state   waiting   for \nbetter   days.   Sachidevi   could   not   contain \nherself  for  sorrow  at  her  husband's  plight \nand   burst   into   tears.   She   acquainted   him \nwith her troubles.  \nIndra   spoke   words   of   courage   to   her. \n\"Nahusha's  end  is  drawing  near,\"  he  said. \n\"Go  to  him  by  yourself  and  tell  him  that \nyou  consent  to  his  proposal.  Ask  him  to \ncome   to   your   residence   in   a   palanquin \ncarried  by  ascetics.  Then  Nahusha  will  be  \ndestroyed.\" \nSachidevi  went  and  pretended  to  agree  to  \nNahusha's  proposal  as  Indra  had  asked  her  \nto  do.  Overjoyed  that  she  had  returned  to  \nhim   in   this   complaisant mood,  the  foolish \nNahusha   burst   out:   \"Blessed   one,   I   am \nyour  slave  and  ready  to  do  you’re  every \nbidding.    You    have    been    true    to    your \nword.\"  \n\"Yes,  I  have  come  back.  You  will  be  my \nhusband.   I   want   you   to   do   something, \nwhich  I  very  much  desire.  Are  you  not  the \nlord  of  the  world?  It  is  my  wish  that  you \nshould  come  majestically  to  my  house  in  a  \ngrander   style   than   the   great   Vishnu   or \nRudra  or  the  asuras.  Let  the  palanquin  be  \nborne  by  the  seven  rishis.  I  shall  then  be \nglad    and    receive    you    and    bid    you \nwelcome,\" she said. \nNahusha  fell  into  the  trap.  \"What  a  grand \nidea!   Your   imagination   is   wonderful.   It \npleases   me   exceedingly.   It   is   but   proper \nthat  the  great  rishis  should  carry  me,  who  \nam  blessed  with  the  powers  of  absorbing \nthe  energy  of  those  on  whom  my  eyes  fall.  \nI     shall     do     exactly     as     you     have \nwished,\"said  he,  and  sent  her  back  home. \nThe   infatuated   Nahusha   called   the   rishis \nand    bade    them    carry    him    on    their \nshoulders.  \nAt   this   sacrilege,   the   three   worlds   were \naghast   and   trembled.   But   worse   was   to \ncome  as  the  palanquin  was  carried  along.  \nInflamed    with    thoughts    of    the    beautiful \nSachidevi   waiting   for   him,   Nahusha   was \nimpatient  to  reach  her  soon.  So  he  began \ngoading   the   rishi-bearers   of   his   palanquin \nto  go  faster.  And  he  went  so  far  in  his  mad  \nwickedness  as  to  kick  Agastya,  one  of  the  \nbearers,    saying    \"sarpa,    sarpa.\"    (Sarpa \nmeans  to  move  and  also  a  serpent.)  The \ninsanity  of  lust  and  arrogance  had  reached  \nits   culmination.   Nahusha's   cup   of   iniquity \nwas full.  \n\"Meanest  of  the  mean,  do  thou  fall  from \nheaven   and   become   a   sarpa   on   earth,\" \ncursed  the  rishi  in  his  wrath.  Immediately \nNahusha     fell     headlong,     down     from \nheaven,  and  became  a  python  in  the  jungle  \nand  had  to  wait  for  several  thousand  years  \nfor  his  deliverance.  Indra  was  restored  to \nhis  state.  He  became  the  king  of  the  gods  \nand Sachidevi's grief ended. \nRelating   this   story   of   the   sufferings   of \nIndra   and   his   wife   to   Yudhishthira   and \nDraupadi   at   Upaplavya,   their   uncle   Salya \ntried to comfort them.  \n\"Victory  awaits  the  patient.  Those,  whom \nprosperity    makes    arrogant,    meet    with \ndestruction.     You,     your     brothers     and \nDraupadi     have     gone     through     untold \nsufferings   like   Indra   and   his   wife.   Your \ntrials   will   soon   be   over   and   you   will \n\nregain    your    kingdom.    The    evil-minded \nKarna  and  Duryodhana  will  be  destroyed \neven as Nahusha was,\" said Salya. \n",

Contingents   arrived   from   all   parts \nof  the  country  and  soon,  the  Pandavas  had  \na   mighty   force   of   seven   divisions.   The \nKauravas   did   likewise   and   collected   an \narmy of eleven divisions. \nThen,  as  now,  a  division  was  made  up  of \nall   arms   grouped   together   in   accordance \nwith  established  military  practice.  In  those \ndays,    a    division    consisted    of    21,870 \nchariots,   an   equal   number   of elephants, \nthrice   as   many   horses   and   five   times   as \nmany     foot     soldiers,     and     they     were \nprovided   with   weapons   of   all   kinds   and \nother war equipment.  \nChariots    were    the    \"armored    cars\"    of \nancient   warfare   and   elephants,   specially \ntrained   for   war,   corresponded   to the   \" \ntanks\" of modern times.  \nDrupada's    brahmana    messenger    reached \nDhritarashtra's     court.     After     the     usual \nceremonial     introduction     and     enquiries \nwere   over,   the   messenger   addressed   the \nassembled    gathering    on    behalf    of    the \nPandavas: \n\"Law   is   eternal   and   of   inherent   validity. \nYou  know  this  and  I  need  not  point  it  out  \nto  you.  Dhritarashtra  and  Pandu  are  both \nVichitravirya's  sons  and  are,  according  to \nour    usages,    equally    entitled    to    their \nfather's     property.     In     spite     of     this, \nDhritarashtra's  sons  have  taken  possession \nof  the  whole  kingdom,  while  Pandu's  sons  \nare   without   their   share   of   the   common \ninheritance.   There   can   be   no   justification \nfor  this.  Scions  of  the  Kuru  dynasty,  the \nPandavas  desire  peace.  They  are  prepared  \nto     forget     the     sufferings     they     have \nundergone  and  to  let  bygones  be  bygones.  \nThey    are    unwilling    to    resort    to    war, \nbecause   they   fully   know   that   war   never \nbrings    any    good    but    only    destruction. \nRender   unto   them,   therefore,   the   things \nthat   are   due   to   them.   This   would   be   in \naccordance  both  with  justice  and with  the  \nagreement   previously   reached.   Let   there \nbe no delay.\" \nAfter   this   appeal   of   the   messenger,   the \nwise   and   brave   Bhishma   spoke.   \"By   the \ngrace  of  God,\"  he  said,  \"the  Pandavas  are  \nsafe     and     well.     Although     they     have \nobtained  the  support  of  many  princes  and \nare  strong  enough  for  battle,  they  are  not \nbent   on   war.   They   still   seek   peace.   To \nrestore  to  them  their  property  is  the  only \nright thing to do.\" \nBhishma    had    not    finished    when    Karna \nangrily    broke    in    and,    turning    to    the \nmessenger,    exclaimed:    \"O    brahmana,    is \nthere  anything  new  in  what  you  have  said?  \nWhat  tortures  it  to  tell  the  same  old  story?  \nHow  can  Yudhishthira  claim  the  property \nthat  he  lost  at  the  game  board?  If,  now, \nYudhishthira   wants   anything,   he   must   beg \nfor  it  as  a  gift!  He  arrogantly  prefers  this \nabsurd    claim    in    fond    reliance    on    the \nstrength   of   his   allies,   particularly   Matsya \nand  Panchala.  Let  me  tell  you  clearly  that  \nnothing  can  be  got  out  of  Duryodhana  by \nthreats.   As   the   plighted   word,   that   the \nPandavas   should   live   undiscovered   during \nthe  thirteenth  year,  has  been  broken,  they \nmust  once  again  go  back  to  the  forest  for  \nanother      twelve      years      and      return \nthereafter.\"  \nBhishma   interposed:   \"Son   of   Radha,   you \nspeak  foolishly.

Please \nreturn at once and tell Yudhishthira this.\"  \nThen   Dhritarashtra   called   Sanjaya   aside \nand   instructed   him   thus:   \"Sanjaya,   go   to \nthe  sons  of  Pandu  and  convey  to  them  my  \naffectionate  regards  and  my  kind  inquiries \nabout   Krishna,   Satyaki   and   Virata.

After   the   introductory \nsalutations,      Sanjaya      thus      addressed \nYudhishthira   in   the   midst   of   his   court: \n\"Dharmaputra,  it  is  my  good  fortune  to  be  \nable   to   see   you   again   with   my   eyes. \nSurrounded   by   princes,   you   present   the \npicture     of     Indra     himself.     The     sight \ngladdens    my    heart.    King    Dhritarashtra \nsends  you  his  best  wishes  and  desires  to \nknow   that   you   are   well   and   happy.   The \nson   of   Ambika   (Dhritarashtra)   detests   all \ntalk   of   war.   He   desires   your   friendship \nand yearns for peace.\"  \nWhen    Dharmaputra    heard    Sanjaya    say \nthis,   he   felt   glad   and   answered:   \"If   so, \nDhritarashtra's  sons  have  been  saved,  nay,  \nwe  have  all  escaped  a  great  tragedy.  I,  too,  \ndesire   only   peace   and   hate   war.   If   our \nkingdom   is   returned   to   us,   we   will   wipe \nout  all  memories  of  the  sufferings  we  have  \nundergone.\" \nSanjaya  spoke  again:  \"Dhritarashtra's  sons \nare   perverse.   Disregarding   their   father's \nadvice   and   their   grandsire's   wise   words, \nthey  are  still  as  wicked  as  ever.  But  you \nshould    not    lose    patience.    Yudhishthira, \nyou  stand  ever  for  right  conduct.  Let  us \neschew    the    great    evil    of    war.    Can \nhappiness    be    gained    with    possessions \nobtained  through  war?  What  good  can  we  \nreap  from  a  kingdom  won  after  killing  our  \nown      relatives?      Do      not      therefore \ncommence  hostilities.  Even  if  one  were  to \ngain   the   whole   earth   bounded   by   the \nocean,  old  age  and  death  are  inescapable.  \nDuryodhana   and   his   brothers   are   fools. \nBut   that   is   no   reason   why   you   should \nswerve   from   rectitude   or   lose   patience. \nEven    if    they    do    not    give    back    your \nkingdom,    you    should    not    abandon    the \nsupreme path of dharma.\"  \nYudhishthira     answered:     \"Sanjaya,    what \nyou  say  is  true.  Rectitude  is  the  best  of \npossessions,     but     are     we     committing \nwrong?   Krishna   knows   the   intricacies   of \nrectitude   and   dharma.   He   wishes   both \nsides well. I shall do as Vasudeva orders.\" \nKrishna  said:  \"I  desire  the  welfare  of  the \nPandavas.  I  desire  also  that  Dhritarashtra \nand  his  sons  should  be  happy.  This  is  a \ndifficult   matter.   I   think   I   can   settle   this \nissue  by  myself  going  to  Hastinapura.  If  I \ncould  obtain  peace  from  the  Kauravas  on \nterms  that  do  not  conflict  with  the  welfare  \nof all,   nothing   would   make   me   and   the \nPandavas   happier.   If   I   succeed   in   doing \nso,  the  Kauravas  will  have  been  rescued \nfrom  the  jaws  of  death.  I  shall  also  have \nachieved   something   good   and   worthwhile. \nEven  if,  through  a  peaceful  settlement,  the \nPandavas  get  back  what  is  due  to  them, \nthey   will   still   serve   Dhritarashtra   loyally. \nThey  desire  nothing  else.  But  they  are  also  \nprepared  for  war  if  need  be.  Of  these  two  \nalternatives,   peace   and   war,   Dhritarashtra \ncan choose what he pleases.\"  \nAnd      Yudhishthira      said      to      Sanjaya: \n\"Sanjaya,  go  back  to  the  Kaurava,  court \nand  tell  the  son  of  Ambika  this  from  me: \n'Was   it   not   through   your   generosity   that \nwe  obtained  a  share  of  the  kingdom  when \nwe   were   young?   You,   who   made   me   a \nking  once,  should  not  deny  us  our  share \nnow   and   drive us   to   make   a   beggar's \nliving  on  the  charity  of  others.  Dear  uncle,  \nthere  is  enough  room  in  the  world  for  both  \nof  us  and  the  Kauravas.  Let  there  be  no \nantagonism,   therefore,   between   us.'   Thus \nshould   you   request   Dhritarashtra   on   my \nbehalf.   Give   the   grandsire   my   love   and \n\nregards  and  ask  him  to  devise  some  way \nof    ensuring    that    his    grandchildren    live \nhappily     in     amity.     Convey     the     same \nmessage   to   Vidura   also.   Vidura   is   the \nperson  who  can  best  see  what  is  good  for  \nall   of   us   and   advise   accordingly.   Explain \nmatters  to  Duryodhana  and  tell  him  on  my \nbehalf:   'My   dear   brother,   you   made   us, \nwho  were  princes  of  the  realm,  live  in  the  \nforest,   clad   in   skins.   You   insulted   and \nharassed     our     weeping     wife     in     the \nassembly   of   princes.   We   bore   all   this \npatiently.  Give  us  back,  at  least  now,  what  \nis    lawfully    ours.    Do    not    covet    what \nbelongs   to   others.   We   are   five.   For   the \nfive   of   us   give   at   least   five   villages   and \nmake  peace  with  us.  We  shall  be  content.  \nSay   thus   to   Duryodhana,   Sanjaya.   I   am \nprepared  and  ready  for  peace  as  well  as \nfor war.\" \nAfter   Yudhishthira   had   said   these   words, \nSanjaya   took   leave   of   Kesava   and   the \nPandavas, and went back to Hastinapura. \n",

And   gave   a   full   account   of \nwhat   had   taken   place   in   Yudhishthira's \ncourt. \n\"Chiefly,   Duryodhana   should   know   what \nArjuna  said:  'Krishna  and  I  are  going  to \ndestroy    Duryodhana    and    his    followers, \nroot  and  branch.  Make  no  mistake  about \nit.  The  Gandiva  bow  is  impatient  for  war.  \nMy   bowstring   is   throbbing   even   without \nmy    stretching    it    and    from    my    quiver, \narrows    keep    peeping    out    impatiently, \ndemanding    when?

Thus \nspoke Dhananjaya,\" said Sanjaya.  \nBhishma    counselled    Dhritarashtra    against \nopposing   the   combined   might   of   Arjuna \nand      Krishna.      \"Karna,      who      boasts \nrepeatedly  that  he  will  slay  the  Pandavas\",  \nsaid  Bhishma,  \"is  not  equal  to  a  sixteenth \npart   of   the   Pandavas.   Your   sons   are \nheading   for   destruction,   listening   to   his \nwords.  When  Arjuna  beat  back  your  son's  \nattack  on  Virata's  capital  and  humbled  his  \npride,  what  was  Karna  able  to  do?  When \nthe   Gandharvas   took   your   son   prisoner, \nwhere    did    the    invincible    Karna    bide \nhimself?   Was   it   not   Arjuna   who   drove \nback   the   Gandharvas?\"   Thus   did   Bhisma \ntaunt Karna and warn the Kauravas.  \n\"What    grandfather    Bhisma    says    is    the \nonly      proper      thing      to      do,\"      said \nDhritarashtra.   \"All   wise   men   say,   and   I \nknow,  that  it  is  best  to  seek  peace.  But \nwhat  can  I  do?  These  fools  would  go  their  \nown way, however loudly I protest.\"  \nDuryodhana,  who  had  been  listening  to  all \nthis,  stood  up.  \"Father,  do  not  worry  and  \ntremble  about  our  safety.  We  know  how \nstrong    we    are.    That    we    shall    win    is \ncertain.   Yudhishthira   knows   it   too,   for, \ngiving   up   all   hope   of   kingdom,   he   only \nbegs  now  for  five  villages.  Is  it  not  clear \nfrom  this  that  he  is  already  scared  about \nour    eleven    divisions?    What    can    the \nPandavas  oppose  to  our  eleven  divisions? \nWhy   then   do   you   doubt   our   victory?\" \nDuryodhana  said  to  his  father  and  tried  to  \ncheer him up. \n\"My   son,   let   us   not   have   war,\"   said \nDhritarashtra.   \"Be   satisfied   with   half   the \nkingdom.   It   is   enough   if   we   govern   that \n\nhalf   well.\"   Duryodhana   could   stand   it   no \nlonger.   \"The   Pandavas   will   not   receive \neven    a    needle-point    of    territory,\"    he \nexclaimed,    and    left    the    court.    In    the \nexcitement  that  prevailed,  the  court  broke \nup. \nLet  us  now  relate  what  the  Pandavas  were  \nsaying   among   themselves.   After   Sanjaya \nleft        Upaplavya        for        Hastinapura, \nYudhishthira   said   to   Krishna:   \"Vasudeva, \nSanjaya  is  Dhritarashtra's  alter  ego.  From \nhis   speech,   I   have   divined   what   is   in \nDhritarashtra's      mind.      Dhritarashtra      is \ntrying   to   secure   peace   without   giving   us \nany  territory.  In  my  simplicity,  I  was  glad \nat  first  when  I  heard  Sanjaya  speak.  But  it  \nsoon    became    clear    that    my    joy was \nunfounded.   He   then   struck   a   middle   line \nand  spoke  desiring  peace.  But  the  words \nwith  which  he  ended  his  message  seemed \nto  commend  meekness  to  us,  even  if  our \njust   rights   were   denied.   Dhritarashtra   has \nnot  been  playing  fair  with  us.  The  crisis  is  \napproaching.   There   are   none   but   you   to \nprotect  us.  I  made  my  offer  that  we  would  \nbe   content   with   only   five   villages.   The \nwicked   Kauravas   will   refuse   even   this. \nHow    can    we    tolerate    this    height    of \nintransigence?   Only   you   can   advise   us   in \nthis   crisis.   There   is   none   but   you   who \nknows   what   our   duty   is   now   and   can \nguide    us    in    dharma    as    well    as    in \nstatesmanship.\"  \nKrishna   said   in   reply:   \"For   the   good   of \nyou    both,    I    have    decided    to    go    to \nHastinapura.   I   shall   go   to   Dhritarashtra's \ncourt  and  try  to  secure  your  rights  without \nwar.  If  my  mission  succeeds,  it  will  be  for  \nthe good of the world.\" \nYudhishthira   said:   \"Krishna,   pray   do   not \ngo.  What  is  the  good  of  your  going  to  the  \nenemies'     place     now?     The     perverse \nDuryodhana  will  stick  to  his  folly.  I  do  not  \nlike  your  going  among  those  unscrupulous  \nmen.  We  cannot  let  you  jeopardise  your \nsafety,    for    the    Kauravas    will    stop    at \nnothing.\"  \nKrishna   answered:   \"Dharmaputra,   I   know \nhow   wicked   Duryodhana   is.   But   still   we \nshould   make   all   attempts   at   a   peaceful \nsolution  so  as  to  give  the  world  no  cause  \nto     accuse     us     of     not     having     done \neverything  possible  to  avert  war.  We  must  \nomit   nothing,   no   matter   how   slender   our \nhopes  of  success.  Have  no  fears  for  my \nsafety,   for,   if   the   Kauravas   offer   me,   a \nmessenger  of  peace,  any  threat  of  bodily \nharm, I will reduce them to ashes.\" \nSaid   Yudhishthira:   \"You   are   all-knowing. \nYou  know  our  hearts  as  well  as  theirs.  In \nexpounding    matters    and    in    the    art    of \npersuasion, there is none better than you.\" \nKrishna   said:   \"Yes,   I   know   you   both. \nYour   mind   ever   clings   to   righteousness \nand   theirs   is   always   steeped   in   hatred, \njealousy  and  enmity.  I  will  do  all  I  can  to  \nsecure  the  result,  which  I  know  is  dear  to  \nyou,   a   settlement   reached   without   war \neven   though   it   may   have,   but   little   for \nyou.   The   signs   are   ominous   and   portend \nwar. Still   duty   demands   that   we   should \nmake the attempt for peace.\" \nThus   saying,   Krishna   took   leave   of   the \nPandavas   and   set   off   in   his   chariot   to \nHastinapura. \n",

      "content": "\nSATYAKI         accompanied         Govinda \n(Krishna)   to   Hastinapura.   Before   setting \nout   on   his journey,   Krishna   had   a   lone \ndiscussion   with   the   Pandavas.   Even   the \nmighty       Bhima,       rather       surprisingly, \nsupported a peaceful settlement.  \n\"Let  not  the  race  be  destroyed.  Peace  is \nvery  much  to  be  preferred,\"  said  he.  The \npoet   Vyasa   makes   Bhima   speak   thus   in \norder   to   show   that   truly   great   warriors \ndesire  peace,  and  that  to  seek  peace  is  not  \na sign of fear. \nBut     Draupadi     could     not     forget     her \nhumiliation.  Holding  her  locks  in  her  hand \nshe  stood  before  Krishna,  and  in  a  voice \n\nquivering        with        grief,        she        said: \n\"Madhusudana,   look   at   these   tresses   of \nmine   and   do   what   honor   requires   to   be \ndone.  There  can  be  no  peace  with  honor.  \nEven   if   Arjuna   and   Bhima   are   against \nwar,  my  father,  old  though  he  is,  will  go \nto  battle,  supported  by  my  children.  Even \nif   my   father   can   keep   out,   my   children, \nwith   Subhadra's   son   Abhimanyu,   at   their \nhead,  will  fight  the  Kauravas.  I  have,  for \nthe   sake   of   Dharmaputra,   these   thirteen \nyears,   suppressed   the   burning   flame   of \nanger  within  me.  I  can  restrain  myself  no \nlonger.\"    And    she    sobbed,    remembering \nthe great outrage.  \nKrishna  was  moved  and  said:  \"Weep  not.  \nDhritarashtra's   sons   will   not   listen   to   my \nwords  of  peace.  They  are  going  to  fall  and  \ntheir bodies  will  be  food  for  wild  dogs  and  \njackals.  You  will  live  to  see  us  victorious \nand    the    insult    to    you    will    be    fully \navenged,   and   that   too,   soon.\"   Draupadi \nwas satisfied.  \nMadhava   (Krishna)   halted   for   the   night \nnear  the  city  of  Kucasthala.  When  news  of  \nKrishna's   forthcoming   visit   came,   the   city \nwas in great excitement.  \nDhritarashtra   issued   orders   for   decorating \nthe   city   and   arrangements   for   receiving \nJanardana   (Krishna)   were   in   full   swing. \nDhritarashtra      issued      instructions      that \nDuhsasana's    palace,    being    bigger    and \nmore   beautiful   than   Duryodhana's,   should \nbe  got  ready  and  placed  at  the  disposal  of  \nKrishna  and  his  entourage  and  large  tents \nwere  erected  at  several  places  outside  the  \ncity,    along    the    route    which    Krishna's \nchariot was to take. \nDhritarashtra  consulted  Vidura.  He  said  to  \nhim:   \"Make   arrangements   for   presenting \nGovinda    with    chariots    and    elephants. \nPresents  of  other  kinds  should  also  be  got  \nready.\" But Vidura said:  \n\"Govinda  cannot  be  bought  with  presents. \nGive  him  that  for  which  he  is  coming  to \nthe  land  of  the  Kurus.  Does  he  not  come  \nhere  seeking  a  peaceful  settlement?  Make \nthat  possible.  You  cannot  satisfy  Madhava  \nwith other gifts.\" \nWhen   Govinda   reached   Hastinapura,   the \ncitizens   had   thronged   in   such   numbers   in \nthe  decorated  streets  that  his  chariot  could  \nonly   progress   very   slowly.   He   went   first \nto      Dhritarashtra's      palace      and      then \nproceeded   to   Vidura's   house.   Kuntidevi \nmet him there.  \nThinking  of  the  sufferings  of  her  sons  and \noverpowered  by  grief,  she  wept.  Krishna \ncomforted   her   and,   taking   leave   of   her, \nmade for Duryodhana's palace.  \nDuryodhana   gave   Govinda   welcome   and \ninvited   him   to   dinner,   but   Krishna said \nwith   a   smile:   \"Emissaries   eat   only   after \ntheir   mission   is   fulfilled.   You   may   give   a \nfeast when my work here is completed.\"  \nDeclining      Duryodhana's      invitation,      he \nreturned    to    Vidura's    house    where    he \nrested. \nVidura  and  Krishna  took  counsel  together.  \nVidura     told     him     that     Duryodhana's \narrogance   was   based   on   his   confidence \nthat  no  one  could  defeat  him  as  long  as \nBhishma  and  Drona,  who,  he  knew,  were  \nunder   a   moral   obligation   not   to   abandon \nhim, stood by him. \nVidura  said  that  it  would  be  a  mistake  for  \nGovinda  even  to  enter  the  wicked  man's \ncourt.  All,  who  knew  Duryodhana  and  his  \nbrothers,    apprehended    that    they    would \nplot,    through    fraud    and    deceit,    against \nKrishna's life.  \n\"What  you  say  about  Duryodhana  is  true. \nI  have  not  come  here  with  any  hope  that  I  \nwould    be    able    to    secure    a    peaceful \nsettlement,    but    only    in    order    that    the \nworld  might  not  hold  me  to  blame.  Have \nno fear for my life,\" said Krishna.  \nThe     next     morning,     Duryodhana     and \nSakuni  came  to  Krishna  and  informed  him \nthat   Dhritarashtra   was   waiting   for   him. \nGovinda   went   to   the   court   along   with \nVidura.  \n\nAs   Vasudeva   came   into   the   court,   that \ngreat    assemblage    of    kings    stood    up. \nSaluting  the  elders  with  folded  hands  and \nwith   a   word   or   a   smile   for   the   others, \nKrishna   took   his   seat.   The   introductions \nover,   Govinda rose   from   his   seat   and, \nturning    to    Dhritarashtra    explained    the \nobject  of  his  visit.  He  made  clear  what  the  \nPandavas wanted.  \n\"Dhritarashtra,   do   not   bring   ruin   to   your \npeople.  You  regard  as  bad  what  is  good \nfor  you  and  as  good  what  is  bad.  It  is  your  \nduty  to  restrain  your  sons.  The  Pandavas \nare  prepared  for  war  but  they  desire  peace.  \nThey  wish  to  live  in  happiness  under  you.  \nTreat  them  also  as  your  sons  and  devise \nan  honorable  solution,  and  the  world  will \nacclaim you,\" said Krishna. \nDhritarashtra   said:   \"My   friends  know  that \nI  am  not  to  blame.  I  desire  precisely  what  \nMadhava  has  stated  but  I  am  powerless. \nMy   wicked   sons   do   not   listen   to   me. \nKrishna,     I     entreat     you     to     advise \nDuryodhana.\" \nKrishna   turned   to   Duryodhana   and   said: \n\"You  are  the  descendant  of  a  noble  line. \nPursue  the  path  of  dharma.  Your  present \nthoughts  are  unworthy  and  befit  only  men \nof   low   birth.   On   account   of   you,   this \nfamous     line     is     in     danger     of     being \ndestroyed.   If   you   listen   to   reason   and \njustice,     the     Pandavas     themselves     will \ninstall  Dhritarashtra  as  king  and  you  as  the  \nheir  apparent.  Make  peace  with  them  by \ngiving them half the kingdom.\" \nBhishma      and      Drona      also      pressed \nDuryodhana    to    listen    to    Govinda.    But \nDuryodhana's  heart  could  not  be  softened.  \n\"I   pity   Dhritarashtra   and   Gandhari   whom \nDuryodhana   is   dooming   to   bereavement \nand    desolation    by    his    misdeeds,\"    said \nVidura. \nDhritarashtra   once   again   said   to   his   son: \n\"If  you  do  not  listen  to  Govinda's  advice, \nour race will perish.\" \nDrona   and   Bhishma   also   tried   repeatedly \nto   persuade   Duryodhana   and   turn   him \nfrom   error.   Duryodhana   was   furious   with \neveryone  for  pressing  him  in  this  matter  to  \nagree  to  a  peaceful  solution.  He  rose,  and  \nsaid: \n\"Madhusudana,  you  wrong  me  out  of  love  \nfor   the   Pandavas.   The   others   here   also \nblame  me,  but  I  do  not  think  I am  one \nwhit     to blame     in     this     matter.     The \nPandavas,   of   their own   volition,   staked \ntheir  kingdom  at  play  and,  being  defeated,  \njustly   forfeited   it.   How   am   I   responsible \nfor  it?  Losing  the  game,  they  went  to  the \nforests  as  in  honor  bound.  For  what  fault \nof  mine  do  they  now  seek  battle  and  wish  \nto   slay   us?   I   will   not   yield   to   threats. \nWhen   I   was   young,   the   elders   did   us \ngrievous  wrong  by  giving  the  Pandavas,  I \ndo  not  know  why,  a  part  of  the  kingdom \nto  which  they  had  not  a  shadow  of  a  right.  \nI  acquiesced  then  but  they  lost  it  at  play.  I  \nrefuse   to   return   it   to   them.   I   am   utterly \nblameless.  I  will  not  give  the  Pandavas  an \ninch   of   land,   not   even   a   needle-point  of \nit!\" \nWhen   Duryodhana   said   that   he   had   not \ncommitted   wrong,   Govinda   laughed   and \nsaid:   \"The   play   was   fraudulently   arranged \nby  you  in  conspiracy  with  Sakuni  and  you \nafterwards     insulted     Draupadi     in     an \nassembly   of   princes.   And   yet,   you   have \nthe    impudence    to    say    that    you    have \ncommitted   no   wrong,\"   and   reminded   him \nof  the  other  iniquities  he  had  perpetrated \nagainst the Pandavas. \nDuhsasana  seeing  that  Bhishma  and  others  \nwere    accepting    Krishna's    indictment    of \nDuryodhana   said:   \"Brother,   it   seems   that \nthese  people  have  a  plot  to  bind  you  with \nropes  and  hand  you  over  to  the  Pandavas.  \nLet     us     get     away     from     here,\"     and \nDuryodhana,       accompanied       by       his \nbrothers, walked out of the court.  \nGovinda   addressed   the   court   again   and \nsaid:  \"Sires,  the  Yadavas  and  Vrishnis  live  \n\nhappily,  now  that  Kamsa  and  Sisupala  are  \ndead.  In  order  to  save  a  whole  people,  it  is  \nsome    times    necessary    to    sacrifice    an \nindividual.       Does       it       not       happen \noccasionally  that  a  village  is  abandoned  in \norder  that  the  country  may  be  saved?  I  am  \nafraid      you      will      have      to      sacrifice \nDuryodhana  if  you  want  to  save  your  race.  \nThat is the only way.\"  \nDhritarashtra   said   to   Vidura:   \"Bring   far-\nsighted   Gandhari   here.   It   is   possible   that \nDuryodhana      might      listen      to      her.\" \nGandhari   was   sent   for   and,   when   she \ncame  to  the  court,  Duryodhana  was  sent \nfor.  \nDuryodhana,    his    eyes    red    with    anger, \nreturned   and   Gandhari   tried   by   all   the \nmeans  in  her  power  to  bring  him  round  to  \nreason.

I  ask  that  I  should  be  \nblind   again,\"   said   Dhritarashtra,   and   he \nbecame  blind  again.  \"All  our  efforts  have \nfailed.    Duryodhana    is    obstinate,\"    said \nDhritarashtra to Govinda.  \nAnd  Krishna  rose  and,  with  Satyaki  and \nVidura   on   either   side   of   him,   left   the \ncourt.  \nHe   went   straight   to   Kunti.   He   told   her \nwhat  had  happened  and  she  asked  him  to  \nconvey her blessings to her sons.  \n\"The   time   has   come,\"   said   she,   \"for   that \nfor  which  a  kshatriya  woman  brings  forth \nsons. May you protect my sons!\"  \nA   kshatriya   mother   brings   forth   children \nto    be    sacrificed   in   war.   Purushottamat \n(Krishna   as   Supreme   Being)   got   into   his \nchariot  and  sped  towards  Upaplavya.  War  \nbecame a certainty. \n",

The   grandsire   will   certainly   not \nwant    to    kill    them.    But    Karna    is    the \nPandavas'   chief   enemy.   He   is   anxious   to \nplease   Duryodhana   by   killing   my   sons. \nKarna  is  a  great  man-at-arms.  As  I  think  \nof  him  engaged  in  battle  against  my  other \nsons,   my   heart   is   consumed   with   agony \nlike  a  faggot  in  the  fire.

Facing \neast   and   with   uplifted   hands   he   was   in \ndeep    meditations.

To    live    in \ndependence   on   Dhritarashtra's   sons,   does \nnot  befit  you.  Join  Arjuna  and  be  one  of \nthe   kings   of   the   realm.   May   you   and \nArjuna  put  down  the  wicked!  The  whole \nworld  will  be  at  your  feet.  Your  fame  will \nreach    far    and    wide,    like    that    of    the \nbrothers        Balarama        and        Krishna. \nSurrounded   by   your   five   brothers,   your \neffulgence   will   be   like   that   of   Brahma \namong   the   gods.   In   perplexing   situations, \none   must   do   what   gives   satisfaction   to \nloving  parents.  This  is  the  highest  dharma \naccording to our scriptures.\" \nWhen  his  mother  spoke  thus  to  him  at  the  \nend  of  his  devotions  to  the  sun,  Karna  felt  \na   sign   in   his   heart   that   the   Sun   god \nendorsed  Kunti's  request.  But  he  checked \nhimself  and  took  it  to  mean  that  the  Sun \ngod  was  testing  his  loyalty  and  strength  of \nmind. He should not be found wanting.  \nWith   an   effort   of   the   will,   he   controlled \nalike   the   temptations   of   self-interest   and \nthe  prompting  of  natural  affection.  He  said  \nsadly   but   firmly:   \"What   you   have   said, \ndear   mother,   is   contrary   to   dharma.   If   I \nswerve  from  the  path  of  duty,  I  shall  have  \ndone  myself  much  more  hurt  than  any  that  \nan    enemy    might    inflict    on    me    in    the \nbattlefield.   You   deprived   me   of   all   that \nwas  my  birthright  as  a  kshatriya  when  you \nthrew  me,  a  helpless  babe,  into  the  river. \nAnd  now,  you  talk  to  me  of  my  duties  as  a  \nkshatriya.   You   denied   me   the   motherly \nlove,   which   blesses   all   life.   And   now, \nthinking    of    your    other    children's    good, \nyou  tell  me  this  story.  If  I  now  join  the \nPandavas,  will  not  the  world  proclaim  that  \nI  have  done  so  out  of  fear?  I  have  eaten \nthe  salt  of  Dhritarashtra's  sons,  won  their \nconfidence  as  their  champion  and  enjoyed \nall   the   consideration   and   kindness   they \nshowed  me.  And  now  you  want  me,  when  \nthe   battle   is   about   to   be   joined,   to   be \nuntrue   to   my   salt   and   go   over   to   the \nPandavas.  The  sons  of  Dhritarashtra  look \non  me  as  the  ark,  which  will  enable  them \nto  cross  the  deluge  of  war.  I  have  myself \nurged  them  into  this  war.  How  can  I  now \ndesert    them?    Could    there    be    blacker \ntreachery   and   baser   ingratitude?   What   in \nlife,  or  beyond  it,  would  be  worth  a  price  \nlike   that?   Mother   dear,   I   must   discharge \n\nmy    debt,    aye,    with    life,    if    necessary; \notherwise,   I   shall   be   no   better   than   a \ncommon    thief    purloining    my    food    all \nthese   years.   I   shall   surely   use   all   my \nfollowers  against  your  sons  in  this  coming \nwar.  I  cannot  deceive  you.  Please  forgive \nme.\"  \n\"But   yet,\"   continued   he,   \"I   cannot   have \nmy  mother  plead completely  in  vain.  Part \nwith Arjuna   to   me.   Either   he   or   myself \nmust  die  in  this  war.  I  will  not  kill  your \nother   sons,   whatever   they   may   do   unto \nme.  Mother  of  warrior  sons,  you  will  still \nhave   five   sons.   Either   I   or   Arjuna   will \nsurvive  this  war.  And  with  the  other  four \nsons, you will still have five\".  \nWhen   Kunti   heard   her   first-born   speak \nthus    firmly,    adhering    to    the    kshatriya \ncode,  her  heart  was  full  of  tumultuous  and  \ncontrary    feelings    and,    without    trusting \nherself  to  speak.  She  embraced  him  and \ndeparted in silence.  \n\"Who    can    go    against    what    has    been \nordained?\"  she  thought.  \"He  has,  at  least, \noffered  not  to  harm  four  of  my  sons.  That  \nis  enough.  May  God  bless  him,\"  and  she \nreturned home. \n",

Her  \nrelatives  approved  the  idea,  all  except  her  \neldest   brother   Rukma,   the   heir   apparent, \nbetween  whom  and  Krishna  there  was  no  \nlove lost.  \nRukma   pressed   his   father   not   to   give \nRukmini    in    marriage    to    the    ruler    of \nDwaraka   but   to   marry   her   instead   to \nSisupala,   the   king   of   Chedi.   The   king \nbeing  old,  Rukma's  became  the  dominant \nvoice   and   it   looked as   though   Rukmini \nwould be compelled to marry Sisupala. \nRukmini,      whose      heart      was      wholly \nKrishna's     because     she     was     Lakshmi \nincarnate,   was   disconsolate.   She   feared \nthat   her   father   would   be   helpless   against \nher  domineering  brother  and  would  not  be  \nable to prevent the unhappy marriage.  \nMustering     all     her     strength     of     mind, \nRukmini  resolved  somehow  to  find  a  way \nout  of  her  predicament.  She  took  counsel \nwith   a   brahmana   whom,   abandoning   all \nmaidenly  reserve,  she  sent  as  her  emissary \nto    Krishna,    charging    him    to    explain \nmatters to her beloved and sue for help. \nThe        brahmana        accordingly        went \ntoDwaraka    and    conveyed    to    Krishna \nRukmini's  sad  plight  and  her  entreaty,  and  \nhanded  to  him  the  letter  Rukmini  had  sent  \nthrough him. The letter ran as follows: \n\"My   heart   has   already accepted   you   as \nlord  and  master.  I  charge  you  therefore  to  \ncome   and   succour   me   before   Sisupala \ncarries  me  off  by  force.  The  matter  cannot  \nbrook   any   delay;   so   you   must   be   here \ntomorrow.   Sisupala's   forces,   as   well   as \nJarasandha's,   will   oppose   you   and   will \nhave  to  be  overcome  before  you  can  have  \nme.  May  you  be  the  triumphant  hero  and \ncapture   me!   My   brother   has   decided   to \nmarry  me  to  Sisupala  and,  as  part  of  the \nwedding   ceremonies,   I   am   going   to   the \ntemple   along   with   my   retinue   to   offer \nworship  to  Parvati.  That  would  be  the  best  \ntime  for  you  to  come  and  rescue  me.  If \nyou  do  not  turn  up,  I  will  put  an  end  to  my  \nlife  so  that  I  may  at  least  join  you  in  my \nnext birth.\" \nKrishna      read      this      and      immediately \nmounted  his  chariot.  At  the  king's  behest, \nKundinapura,  the  capital  of  Vidarbha,  was  \nmost        gorgeously        decorated        and \npreparations    for    the    wedding    of    the \nprincess with Sisupala were in full swing.  \n\nThe   bridegroom   elect   and   his   associates, \nall  sworn  enemies  of  Krishna,  had  already \nassembled   in   the   capital.   Balarama   came \nto   know   of   Krishna's   sudden   and   secret \ndeparture, all by himself.  \nGuessing    that    it    must    be    about    the \ndaughter   of   the   king   of   Vidarbha   and \nanxious  lest  Krishna  should  be  hemmed  in \nalone   by   mortal   enemies   thirsting   for   his \nblood,    he    hurriedly    assembled    a    great \nforce and marched on to Kundinapura. \nLeaving       her       apartments,       Rukmini, \naccompanied    by    her    retinue,    went    in \nprocession   to   the   temple,   where   divine \nservice was held. \n\"Oh  Devi,\"  implored  Rukmini,  praying  for \nher  intercession.  \"I  prostrate  myself  before  \nthee who  knowest  my  devotion.  Grant  that  \nKrishna may espouse me.\" \nStepping    out    of    the    temple,    Rukmini \nsighted   Krishna's   chariot   and   ran   straight \nas  a  needle  to  the  attracting  magnet.  She \nfled  to  him  and  got  into  his  chariot.  And \nKrishna    drove    off    with    her,    to    the \nbewilderment of all around.  \nThe    servants    ran    to    Rukma,    the    heir \napparent,  and  related  what  had  happened.  \n\"I      will      not      return      without      killing \nJanardana,\"   swore   Rukma,   and   went   in \npursuit of Krishna with a large force.  \nBut,    meanwhile,    Balarama    had    arrived \nwith  his  army,  and  a  great  battle  ensued \nbetween  the  two  opposing  forces  in  which \nthe   enemy   was   utterly   routed.   Balarama \nand   Krishna   returned   home   in   triumph, \nwhere    Rukmini's    wedding    with    Krishna \nwas celebrated with customary rites.  \nThe    defeated    Rukma    was   ashamed   to \nreturn   to   Kundinapura   and   built   at   the \nvery   site   of   the   battle   between   Krishna \nand   himself   a   new   city,   Bhojakata,   over \nwhich he ruled.  \nHearing  of  the  Kurukshetra  battle,  Rukma \narrived  there  with  a  huge  force.  Thinking \nthat  he  could  thereby  win  the  friendship  of  \nVasudeva,     he     offered     help     to     the \nPandavas. \n\"Oh     Pandavas,\"     said     he     addressing \nDhananjaya,   \"the   enemy   forces   are   very \nlarge.  I  have  come  to  help  you.  Give  me \nthe   word   and   I   shall   attack   whichever \nsector  of  the  enemy  formation  you  would \nlike  me  to.  I  have  the  strength  to  attack \nDrona,   Kripa   or   even   Bhishma.   I   shall \nbring  you  victory.  Only  let  me  know  your  \nwish.\" \nTurning       to       Vasudeva,       Dhananjaya \nlaughed.  \n\"Oh,  ruler  of  Bhojakata,\"  said  Arjuna,  \"we  \nare   not   afraid   of   the   size   of   the   enemy \nforces.  We  have  no  need  of  your  help  and  \ndo   not   particularly   desire   it.   You   may \neither   go   away   or   stay   on,   just   as   you \nlike.\"  \nAt  this,  Rukma  was  filled  with  anger  and \nshame   and   went   to   Duryodhana's   camp \nwith    his    army.    \"The    Pandavas    have \nrefused  my  proffered  assistance.\"  Said  he \nto   Duryodhana.   \"My   forces   are   at   your \ndisposal.\"  \n\"Is  it  not  after  the  Pandavas  rejected  your  \nassistance    that    you    have    come    here?\" \nexclaimed  Duryodhana,  and  added:  \"I  am \nnot  in  such  dire  need  yet  as  to  welcome \ntheir leavings.\"  \nRukma,  thus  put  to  disgrace  by  both  sides,  \nreturned   to   his   kingdom   without   taking \npart  in  battle.  Neutrality  in  war  may  be  of \nseveral kinds.  \nIt   may   arise   from   conscientious   objection \nto  war  or  it  may  be  due  to  mere  conceit  \nand   self-interest.   Yet   others   may   keep \naloof through cowardice or sheer inertia.  \nBalarama  was  neutral  in  the  Mahabharata \nwar  because  of  his  love  of  peace.  Rukma,  \non  the  other  hand,  abstained  as  a  result  of  \nhis conceit.  \nInstead  of  acting  according  to  dharma,  he \nthought  of  personal  glory,  and  neither  side  \nwould have him. \n",

      "content": "\n\nIT  was  the  day  before  the  commencement  \nof  the  great  battle.  The  grandsire,  now  the  \nKaurava       Generalissimo,       was       with \nDuryodhana   seeking   to   inspire   him   with \nhis own heroic spirit and cheerfulness.  \nBhishma   spoke of   the   strength,   skill   and \nprowess   of   the   warriors   ranged   on   the \nKauravas'   side.   Duryodhana   was   cheered \nup.   Presently,   Karna   became   the   subject \nof their talk. \n\"Karna   has   earned   your   affection,\"   said \nBhishma,  \"but  I  do  not  think  much  of  him.  \nI   do   not   like   his   great   hatred   of   the \nPandavas,  and  he  is  too  boastful.  There  is  \nno  limit  to  his  arrogance  and  he  is  much \ngiven   to   disparaging   others.   I   would   not \nplace   him   in   the   highest   rank   among   the \nwarriors  of  the  land.  Besides,  he  has  given  \naway  the  divine  armor  with  which  he  was  \nborn.  He  is  not  therefore  likely  to  be  of \ngreat  help  to  me  in  this  battle.  The  curse \nof    Parasurama    is    on    him    too.    His \ncommand    of    supernatural    weapons    will \nfail  him  in  his  hour  of  need,  for  he  will  not  \nbe  able  to  remember  the  mantras.  And  the \nbattle   that   will   ensue   between   him   and \nArjuna will prove fatal for Karna.\"  \nThus    spoke    Bhishma    without    mincing \nmatters,      and      this      was      exceedingly \nunpalatable  to  Duryodhana  and  Karna.  To  \nmake   matters   worse,   Drona   agreed   with \nthe grandsire and said: \n\"Karna is       full       of       pride       and \noverconfidence,   which   will cause   him   to \nbe    neglectful    of    the    finer    points    of \nstrategy,  and  through  carelessness,  he  will \nsuffer defeat.\" \nEnraged   by   these   harsh   words,   Karna \nturned  to  the  grandsire  with  flaming  eyes. \n\"You   sir,\"   said   he,   \"have   always   slighted \nme   through   mere   dislike   and   envy   and \nhave   never   neglected   an   opportunity   of \nhumiliating    me,    though    I    gave    you    no \nreason.  I  bore  all  your  taunts  and  thrusts \nfor   the   sake   of   Duryodhana.   You   have \nsaid  that  I  would  not  be  of  much  help  in \nthe   impending   war.   Let   me   tell   you   my \nsettled   conviction,   it   is   you,   not   I,   who \nwill  fail  the  Kauravas.  Why  hide  your  real \nfeelings?  The  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  you \nhave        no        genuine        affection        for \nDuryodhana,   but   he   does   not   know   it. \nHating  me  you  seek  to  come  between  me  \nand    Duryodhana    and    poison    his    mind \nagainst   me.   And   in   furtherance   of   your \nwicked   design,   you   have   been   belittling \nmy   strength   and   running   me   down.   You \nhave   stooped   to   behavior   unworthy   of   a \nkshatriya.   Age   alone   does   not   confer   a \ntitle  to  honor  and  respect  among  warriors,  \nbut   prowess   does.   Desist   from   poisoning \nour relations.\"  \nTurning then to Duryodhana, Karna said: \n\"Illustrious  warrior,  think  well  and  look  to \nyour  own  good.  Do  not  place  too  great  a  \nreliance  on  the  grandsire.  He  is  trying to \nsow     dissension     in     our     ranks.     His \nappraisement  of  me  will  injure  your  cause.  \nBy  running  me  down,  he  seeks  to  dampen \nmy  enthusiasm.  He  has  become  senile  and  \nhis  time  is  up.  His  arrogance  does  not  let  \nhim   have   regard   for   anyone   else.   Age \nmust  be  respected  and  experience  is  useful  \nbut,  as  the  sastras  warn  us,  there  is  a  point  \nwhen   age   becomes   senility   and   ripeness \nfalls  into  rottenness  and  decay.  You  have \nmade   Bhishma   your   Generalissimo   who \nwill,   I   have   no   doubt,   earn   some   fame \nfrom  the  heroic  deeds  of  others.  But  I  will  \nnot   bear   arms   while   he   is   in   command. \nOnly after he has fallen will I do so.\" \nThe   arrogant   man   is   never   conscious   of \nhis  own  arrogance.  When  accused  of  it,  he  \ncharges   the   accuser   with   that   very   fault. \nHis  judgment  is  warped  and  he  considers \nit  a  crime  on  the  part  of  anyone  to  point \nout   his   defect.   This   is   well   illustrated   in \nthis episode. \nControlling    his    anger,    Bhishma    replied: \n\"Son  of  Surya,  we  are  in  a  crisis  and  that  \nis   why   you   have   not   ceased   to   live   this \nmoment.  You  have  been  the  evil  genius  of  \n\nthe     Kauravas.\"     Duryodhana     was     in \ndistress. \n\"Son   of   Ganga,   I   need   the   help   of   you \nboth,\"  he  said.  \"You  will  both  do  deeds  of  \ngreat   heroism,   I   have   no   doubt.   At   the \nbreak  of  dawn,  the  battle  joins.  Let  there \nbe  no  fighting  among  friends,  with  the  foe  \nin full force before us!\" \nBut  Karna  was  adamant  in  that  he  would \nnot  take  up  arms  so  long  as  Bhishma  was  \nin      supreme      command.      Duryodhana \neventually   yielded   to   Karna   and   suffered \nhim to carry out his threat. \nKarna  kept  out  during  the  first  ten  days  of  \nthe  battle,  though  all  his  men  participated \nin  it.  At  the  end  of  the  tenth  day,  when  the  \ngreat    Bhishma    lay    on    the    battlefield \ncovered  all  over  with  arrows,  Karna  went  \nto   him   and   bowed   reverently   and   asked \nfor   forgiveness   and   blessings,   which   he \nreceived. \nThereafter,  Karna  cooperated  and  himself \nproposed  Drona  for  the  command  of  the \nKaurava  forces  in  succession  to  Bhishma. \nWhen  Drona  also  fell,  Karna  took  over  the  \ncommand and led the Kaurava forces. \n",

The \nwarriors   on   both   sides   gathered   together \nand   solemnly   bound   themselves   to   honor \nthe traditional rules of war.  \nThe  code  of  conduct  in  war  and  methods  \nof   warfare   vary   from   time   to   time.   It   is \nonly  if  what  was  in  vogue  at  the  time  of \nthe  Mahabharata  war  is  kept  in  mind  that  \nwe   can   understand   the   epic.   Otherwise, \nthe story would be puzzling in places. \nFrom  what  follows,  the  reader  may  have \nsome  idea  of  the  rules  of  warfare  followed  \nin   the   Kurukshetra   battle.   Each   day,   the \nbattle  was  over  at  sunset,  and  the  hostiles  \nmixed freely like friends.  \nSingle   combats   might   only   be   between \nequals  and  one  could  not  use  methods  not  \nin   accordance   with   dharma.   Thus   those \nwho  left  the  field  or  retired  would  not  be  \nattacked.  A  horseman  could  attack  only  a  \nhorseman, not one on foot.  \nLikewise,  charioteers,  elephant  troops  and \ninfantrymen    could    engage    themselves    in \nbattle  only  with  their  opposite  numbers  in \nthe enemy ranks.  \nThose  who  sought  quarter  or  surrendered \nwere  safe  from  slaughter.  Nor  might  one, \nfor    the    moment    disengaged,    direct    his \nweapons     against     another     who     was \nengaged in combat. \nIt  was  wrong  to  slay  one  who  had  been \ndisarmed  or  whose  attention  was  directed \nelsewhere  or  who  was  retreating  or  who \nhad  lost  his  armor.  And  no  shafts  were  to  \nbe       directed       against       non-combatant \nattendants   or   those   engaged   in   blowing \nconchs or beating drums.  \nThese   were   the   rules   that   the   Kauravas \nand  the  Pandavas  solemnly  declared  they \nwould follow. \nThe  passage  of  time  has  witnessed  many \nchanges  in  men's  ideas  of  right  and  wrong.  \nNothing  is  exempt  from  attack  in  modern \nwarfare.  \nNot  only  are  munitions  made  the  target  of \nattack,  but  dumb  animals  such  as  horses, \ncamels,   mules   and   medical   stores,   nay, \nnon-combatants  of  all  ages,  are  destroyed \nwithout compunction. \nSometimes     the     established     conventions \nwent   overboard  even  in  the  Mahabharata \nwar.  \nWe  see  clearly  in  the  story  that  occasional \ntransgressions   took   place   for   one   reason \nor    another.    But,    on    the    whole,    the \naccepted   rules   of   honorable   and   humane \nwar  were  observed  by  both  sides  in  the \nKurukshetra    battle.    And   the   occasional \nviolations  were  looked  upon  as  wrong  and  \nshameful. \nAddressing      the      princes      under      his \ncommand,   Bhishma   said:   \"Heroes,   yours \nis  a  glorious  opportunity.  Before  you,  are \nthe  gates  of  heaven  wide  open.  The  joy  of  \nliving  with  Indra  and  Brahma  awaits  you. \n\nPursue   the   path   of   your   ancestors   and \nfollow   the   kshatriya   dharma.   Fight   with \njoy   and   attain   fame   and   greatness.   A \nkshatriya  does  not  wish  to  die  of  disease \nor  old  age  in  his  bed  but  prefers  to  die  on  \nthe  battlefield,\"  and  the  princes  responded \nby  ordering  their  trumpets  to  be  sounded \nand shouted victory to the Kauravas.  \nOn    Bhishma's    flag    shone    brightly    the \npalm  tree  and  five  stars.  On  Aswatthama's  \nthe lion tail fluttered in the air.  \nIn    Drona's    golden-hued    standard,    the \nascetic's  bowl  and  the  bow  glistened,  and  \nthe   cobra   of   Duryodhana's   famed   banner \ndanced proudly with outspread hood.  \nOn  Kripa's  flag  was  depicted  a  bull,  while  \nJayadratha's  carried  a  wild  boar.  Likewise  \nothers  and  the  battlefield  thus  presented  a \npageant of flags.  \nSeeing  the  Kaurava  forces  ranged  in  battle  \narray, Yudhishthira gave orders to Arjuna: \n\"The  enemy  force  is  very  large.  Our  army \nbeing    smaller,    our    tactics    should    be \nconcentration   rather   than   deployment   that \nwill   only   weaken   us.   Array   our   forces,  \ntherefore, in needle formation.\" \nNow,  when  Arjuna  saw  men  arrayed  on \nboth   sides   for   mutual   slaughter,   he   was \ndeeply  agitated  and  Krishna  spoke  to  him \nin  order  to  quell  his  agitation  and  remove \nhis doubts. \nKrishna's   exhortation   to   Arjuna   at   this \njuncture   is   the   Bhagavad   Gita,   which   is \nenshrined    in    millions    of    hearts    as    the \nWord   of   God.   The   Bhagavad   Gita   is \nacknowledged    by    all    as    one    of    the \nsupreme treasures of human literature.  \nIts   gospel   of   devotion   to   duty,   without \nattachment  or  desire  of  reward,  has  shown  \nthe  way  of  life  for  all  men,  rich  or  poor,  \nlearned  or  ignorant,  who  have  sought  for \nlight in the dark problems of life. \n",

Tell  us  what  you \nare     about.\"     Thus     said     Arjuna     to \nDharmaputra.      But      Yudhishthira      was \nimmersed  in  deep  thought  and  proceeded \nforward silently.  \nThen  Vasudeva,  who  knew  the  hearts  of \nmen,  smiled  and  said:  \"He  is  going  to  the  \nelders  to  ask  for  their  benediction  before \ncommencing   this   terrible   fight.   He   feels   it \nis    not    right    to    start    such    a    grave \nproceeding   without   formally   taking   such \nbenediction   and   permission.   He   goes   to \nthe  grandsire  to  take  his  blessing  and  that  \nof  Dronacharya.  So  he  goes  unarmed.  It  is  \nright    that    he    does    this.    He    knows \nproprieties.   It   is   only   thus   that   we   might \nfare well in this battle.\" \nThe men   in   Duryodhana's   army,   when \nthey    saw    Yudhishthira    advancing    with \nhands  clasped  in  humble  attitude,  thought: \n\n\"Here   is   the   Pandava   coming   to   sue   for \npeace,   frightened   at   our   strength.   Truly \nthis   man   brings   disgrace   to   the   race   of \nkshatriyas.   Why   was   this coward   born \namong   us?\"   Thus   did   they   talk   among \nthemselves    reviling    Dharmaputra    though \ndelighted    at    the    prospect    of    securing \nvictory without a blow. \nYudhishthira    went    through    the    lines    of \nsoldiers   armed   from   head   to   foot   and \nproceeded  straight  to  where  Bhishma  was  \nand,  bending  low  and  touching  his  feet  in \nsalutation, said:  \n\"Grandsire,  permit  us  to  begin  the  battle. \nWe  have  dared  to  give  battle  to  you,  our  \nunconquerable          and          incomparable \ngrandsire.    We    seek    benediction    before \nbeginning the fight.\" \n\"Child,\"  replied  the  grandsire,  \"born  in  the  \nrace  of  Bharatas,  you  have  acted  worthily \nand  according  to  our  code  of  conduct.  It \ngives   me   joy   to   see   this.   Fight   and   you \nwill  have  victory.  I  am  not  a  free  agent.  I  \nam   bound   by   my   obligation   to   the   king \nand    must    fight    on    the    side    of    the \nKauravas. But you will not be defeated.\" \nAfter   thus   obtaining   the   permission   and \nthe       blessings       of       the       grandsire, \nYudhishthira      went      to      Drona      and \ncircumambulated  and  bowed,  according  to \nform,   to   the   acharya,   who   also   gave   his \nblessings, saying: \n\"I  am  under  inescapable  obligations  to  the  \nKauravas,  O  son  of  Dharma.  Our  vested \ninterests    enslave    us    and    become    our \nmasters.  Thus  have  I  become  bound  to  the  \nKauravas.   I   shall   fight   on   their   side.   But \nyours will be the victory.\" \nYudhishthira     similarly approached     and \nobtained  the  blessings  of  Kripacharya  and \nuncle  Salya  and  returned  to  the  Pandava \nlines. \nThe  battle  began,  commencing  with  single \ncombats  between  the  leading  chiefs  armed  \nwith  equal  weapons.  Bhishma  and  Partha, \nSatyaki   and   Kritavarma,   Abhimanyu   and \nBrihatbala,      Duryodhana      and      Bhima, \nYudhishthira          and          Salya,          and \nDbrishtadyumna    and    Drona    were    thus \nengaged in great battles.  \nSimilarly,    thousands    of    other    warriors \nfought  severally  according  to  the  rules  of \nwar of those days.  \nBesides    these    numerous   single   combats \nbetween    renowned    warriors,    there    was \nalso       indiscriminate       fighting       among \ncommon   soldiers.   The   name   of   \"sankula \nyuddha\"   was   given   to   such   free   fighting \nand         promiscuous         carnage.         The \nKurukshetra   battle   witnessed   many   such \n\"sankula\"    fights    wherein    countless    men \nfought  and  died  in  the  mad  lust  of  battle. \nOn    the    field    lay    piles    of    slaughtered \nsoldiers,  charioteers,  elephants  and  horses. \nThe   ground   became   a   bloody   mire   in \nwhich   it   was   difficult   for   the   chariots   to \nmove  about.  In  modern  battles  there  is  no  \nsuch   thing   as   single   combats.   It   is   all \n\"sankula.\" \nThe    Kauravas    fought    under    Bhishma's \ncommand  for  ten  days.  After  him,  Drona \ntook   the   command.   When   Drona   died, \nKarna  succeeded  to  the  command.  Karna \nfell   towards   the   close   of   the   seventeenth \nday's   battle.   And   Salya   led   the   Kaurava \narmy on the eighteenth and last day. \nTowards  the  latter  part  of  the  battle,  many  \nsavage  and  unchivalrous  deeds  were  done.  \nChivalry   and   rules   of   war   die   hard,   for \nthere    is    an    innate    nobility    in    human \nnature.      But      difficult      situations      and \ntemptations  arise  which  men  are  too  weak  \nto     resist,     especially     when     they     are \nexhausted   with   fighting   and   warped   with \nhatred and bloodshed.  \nEven   great   men   commit   wrong   and   their \nlapses   thereafter   furnish   bad   examples   to \nothers,     and     dharma     comes     to     be \ndisregarded   more   and   more   easily   and \nfrequently.   Thus   does   violence   beget   and \nnourish  adharma  and  plunge  the  world  in \nwickedness. \n\n",

The   noise   of   battle   rolled \nand     rent     the     air.     The     kettledrums, \ntrumpets,  horns  and  conchs  made  the  sky \nring with their clamor. \nHorses      neighed,      charging      elephants \ntrumpeted   and   the   warriors   uttered   their \nlion-roars.   Arrows   flew   in   the   air   like \nburning  meteors. Fathers  and  sons,  uncles \nand  nephews  slew  one  another  forgetful  of \nold  affection  and  ties  of  blood.  It  was  a \nmad  and  terrible  carnage.  In  the  forenoon \nof  the  first  day's  battle  the  Pandava  army \nwas   badly   shaken.   Wherever   Bhishma's \nchariot  went,  it  was  like  the  dance  of  the  \ndestroyer.  Abhimanyu  could  not  bear  this \nand  he  attacked  the  grandsire.  When  the \noldest  and  the  youngest  warriors  thus  met \nin   battle,   the   gods   came   to   watch   the \ncombat.   Abhimanyu's   flag,   displaying   the \ngolden   karnikara   tree   brightly   waved   on \nhis chariot.  \nKritavarma  was  hit  by  one  of  his  arrows \nand   Salya   was   hit   five   times.   Bhishma \nhimself      was      hit      nine      times      by \nAbhimanyu's           shafts.           Durmukha's \ncharioteer     was     struck     by     one     of \nAbhimanyu's   sword-edge   arrow   and   his \nsevered head rolled on the ground.  \nAnother  broke  Kripa's  bow.  Abhimanyu's \nfeats   brought   down   showers   of   flowers \nfrom   the   gods   who   looked   on.   Bhishma \nand  the  warrior  supporting  him  exclaimed: \n\"Indeed, a worthy son to Dhananjaya!\" \nThen    the    Kaurava    warriors    made    a \ncombined  attack  on  the valiant  youth.  But  \nhe  stood  against  them  all.  He  parried  with \nhis    own    all    the    shafts    discharged    by \nBhishma.  \nOne  of  his  well-aimed  arrows  brought  the  \ngrandsire's   palm   tree   flag   down.   Seeing \nthis,  Bhimasena  was  overjoyed  and  made \na   great   lion-roar   that   further   inspired   the \nvaliant  nephew.  Great  was  the  grandsire's \njoy,   seeing   the   valor   of   the   young   hero. \nUnwillingly,     he     had     to     use     his     full \nstrength   against   the   boy.   Virata,   his   son \nUttara,     Dhrishtadyumna,     the     son     of \nDrupada   and   Bhima   came   to   relieve   the \nyoung   hero   and   attacked   the   grandsire \nwho then turned his attentions on them.  \nUttara,  the  son  of  Virata,  rode  an  elephant  \nand  led  a  fierce  charge  on  Salya.  Salya's \nchariot  horses  were  trampled  to  death  and  \nthereupon  he  hurled  a  javelin  at  Uttara.  It  \nwent  with unerring  aim  and  pierced  him  in \nthe chest.  \nThe  goad  he  had  in  his  hand  dropped  and  \nhe  rolled  down  dead.  But  the  elephant  did  \nnot   withdraw.   It   continued   charging   until \nSalya  cut  off  its  trunk  and  hit  it  in  many \nplaces  with  his  arrows.  And  then  it  uttered  \na  loud  cry  and  fell  dead.  Salya  got  into \nKritavarma's car. \nVirata's   son   Sveta   saw   Salya   slay   his \nyounger  brother.  His  anger  rose,  like  fire \nfed  by  libations  of  butter.  And  he  drove \nhis   chariot   towards   Salya.   Seven   chariot \nwarriors   at   once   came   up   in   support  of \nSalya and protected him from all sides.  \nArrows  were  showered  on  Sveta  and  the \nmissiles    sped    across    like    lightning    in \nclouds.        Sveta        defended        himself \nmarvelously.   He   parried   their   shafts   with \nhis   own   and   cut   their   javelins   down   as \nthey   sped   towards   him.   The   warriors   in \nboth   armies   were   amazed   at   the   skill \ndisplayed   by   Sveta.   Duryodhana   lost   no \ntime  now  and  sent  forces  to  relieve  Salya.  \nWhereupon    there    was    a    great    battle. \nThousands     of     soldiers     perished,     and \nnumerous   were   the   chariots   broken   and \nthe    horses    and    elephants    killed.    Sveta \nsucceeded  in  putting  Duryodhana's  men  to  \nflight  and  he  pushed  forward  and  attacked  \nBhishma.  \nBhishma's    flag    was    brought    down    by \nSveta.  Bhishma,  in  his  turn,  killed  Sveta's \nhorses   and   charioteer.   There   upon,   they \n\nhurled   javelins  at  one  another  and  fought \non.  \nSveta  took  a  mace,  and  swinging  it,  sent  it  \nat   Bhishma's   car   which   was   smashed   to \npieces.  But  the  grandsire,  even  before  the \nmace    dashed    against    the    chariot,    had \nanticipated  it  and  jumped  down.  From  the  \nground  he  pulled  the string  of  his  bow  to  \nhis  ear  and  sent  a  fatal  arrow  at  Sveta. \nSveta  was  struck  and  fell  dead.  Duhsasana  \nblew  his  horn  and  danced  in  joy.  This  was  \nfollowed  by  a  great  attack  on  the  Pandava  \narmy by Bhishma. \nThe   Pandava   forces   suffered   greatly   on \nthe   first   day   of   the   battle.   Dharmaputra \nwas     seized     with     apprehension,     and \nDuryodhana's   joy   was   unbounded.   The \nbrothers    came    to    Krishna    and    were \nengaged in anxious consultations. \n\"Chief   among   Bharatas,\"   said   Krishna   to \nYudhishthira,    \"do    not    fear.    God    has \nblessed   you   with   valiant   brothers.   Why \nshould  you  entertain  any  doubts?  There  is \nSatyaki  and  there  are  Virata,  Drupada  and  \nDhrishtadyumna,     besides     myself.     What \nreason  is  there  for  you  to  be  dejected?  Do  \nyou   forget   that   Sikhandin   is   awaiting   for \nhis    predestined    victim    Bhishma?\"    Thus \ndid Krishna comfort Yudhishthira.  \n",

Duryodhana   had   ordered \nhis   men   to   protect   the   grandsire   most \nvigilantly   and   never   to   let   him   expose \nhimself to danger.  \nAccordingly,   all   the   warriors,   supporting \nthe    grandsire,    at    once    intervened    and \nattacked  Arjuna  who,  however,  fought  on \nunconcerned.  \nIt   was   well   known   that   there   were   but \nthree  on  the  Kaurava  side  who  could  stand  \nagainst  Arjuna  with  any  chance  of  success  \nthe  grandsire  Bhishma,  Drona  and  Karna. \nArjuna  made  short  work  of  the  warriors, \nwho intervened in support of Bhishma.  \nThe   way   in   which   he   wielded   his   great \nbow    on    this    occasion,    extorted    the \nadmiration  of  all  the  great  generals  in  the \narmy.    His    chariot    flashed    hither    and \nthither   sundering   hostile   ranks   like   forked \nlightning,  so  rapidly  that  the  eye  ached  to \nfollow its career. \nDuryodhana's    heart    beat    fast    as    he \nwatched   this   combat.   His   confidence   in \nthe great Bhishma began to be shaken. \n\"Son    of    Ganga,\"    Duryodhana    said,    \"it \nseems  as  if  even  while  you  and  Drona  are  \nalive and      fighting,      this      irresistible \ncombination   of   Arjuna   and   Krishna   will \ndestroy   our   entire   army.   Karna   whose \ndevotion    and    loyalty    to    me    are    most \ngenuine  stands  aside  and  does  not  fight  for  \nme  only  because  of  you.  I  fear  I  shall  be  \ndeceived    and    you    will    not take   steps \nquickly to destroy Phalguna (Arjuna).\" \n\nThe  gods  came  down  to  watch  the  combat  \nbetween  Bhishma  and  Arjuna.  These  were  \ntwo  of  the  greatest  warriors  on  earth.  Both  \nchariots were drawn by white steeds.  \nFrom  either  side  flew  arrows  in  countless \nnumber.   Shaft   met   shaft   in   the   air   and \nsometimes     the     grandsire's     missile     hit \nArjuna's    breast    and    that    of    Madhava \n(Krishna).   And   the   blood   flowing   made \nMadhava   more   beautiful   than   ever   as   he \nstood  like  a  green  palasa  tree  in  full  bloom  \nwith crimson flowers. \nArjuna's  wrath  rose  when  he  saw  his  dear  \ncharioteer  hit  and  he  pulled  his  bow  and \nsent   well-aimed   arrows   at   the   grandsire. \nThe  combatants  were  equal  and  the  battle  \nraged for a long while.  \nIn  the  movements  the  chariots  made  they \nwere  so  close  to  one  another  and  moved  \nabout  so  fast  that  it  was  not  possible  to  say  \nwhere   Arjuna   was   and   where   Bhishma. \nOnly the flag could be distinguished.  \nAs   this   great   and   wonderful   scene   was \nenacted  in  one  part  of  the  field,  at  another  \nplace   a   fierce   battle   was   being   fought \nbetween    Drona    and    his    born    enemy \nDhrishtadyumna,   the   son   of   the   king   of \nthe Panchalas and brother of Draupadi.  \nDrona's      attack      was      powerful      and \nDhrishtadyumna   was   wounded   badly.   But \nthe   latter   retaliated   with   equal   vigor   and \nwith  a  grin  of  hatred  he  shot  arrows  and  \nsped other missiles at Drona.  \nDrona defended   himself   with   great   skill. \nHe   parried   the   sharp   missiles   and   the \nheavy    maces    hurled    at    him    with    his \narrows  and  broke  them  to  pieces  even  as  \nthey sped in the air.  \nMany    times    did    Dhrishtadyumna's    bow \nbreak,   hit   by   Drona's   arrows.   One   of \nDrona's     arrows     killed     the     Panchala \nprince's            charioteer.            Thereupon \nDhrishtadyumna    took    up    a    mace    and, \njumping    down    from    the    chariot,    went \nforward on foot.  \nDrona  sent  an  arrow  that  brought  the  mace  \ndown.    Dhrishtadyumna    then    drew    his \nsword   and   rushed   forward   like   a   lion \nspringing  on  its  elephant  prey.  But  Drona \nagain    disabled    him    and    prevented    his \nadvance.  \nJust  then  Bhima,  who  saw  the  Panchala's \npredicament,  sent  a  shower  of  arrows  on \nDrona    and    carried    Dhrishtadyumna    to \nsafety in his chariot. \nDuryodhana     who     saw     this     sent     the \nKalinga   forces   against   Bhimasena.   Bhima \nkilled     the     Kalinga     warriors     in     great \nnumber.  Like  Death  itself  he  moved  about  \namong  his  enemies  and  felled  them  to  the \nground.  So  fierce  was  the  destruction  that  \nthe entire army trembled in fear.  \nWhen    Bhishma    saw    this,    he    came    to \nrelieve   the   Kalingas.   Satyaki,   Abhimanyu \nand  other  warriors  came  up  in  support  of \nBhima.   One   of   Satyaki's   shafts   brought \nBhishma's  charioteer  down  and  the  horses \nof    Bhishma's    chariot,    left    uncontrolled, \nbolted   carrying   Bhishma   away   from   the \nfield.  \nThe     Pandava     army     was     wild     with \nenthusiasm   when   Bhishma's   chariot   sped \nthus  out  of  the  field.  They  took  advantage  \nof  the  situation  and  made  a  fierce  attack \non the Kaurava army.  \nGreat   was   the   loss   the   Kaurava   army \nsuffered  in  that  day's  battle  as  a  result  of \nArjuna's   deeds   of   valor.   The   generals   of \nthe  Kaurava  army  were  greatly  perturbed \nand   their   previous   day's   enthusiasm   had \nall disappeared.  \nThey   eagerly   looked   forward   to   sunset \nwhen  there  would  be  an  end  to  the  day's  \nbattle.   As   the   sun   sank   in   the   west, \nBhishma  said  to  Drona:  \"It  is  well  we  stop  \nthe      fighting      now.      Our      army      is \ndisheartened and weary.\" \nOn  the  side  of  the  Pandavas,  Dhananjaya \nand  others  returned  in  great  cheer  to  their  \ncamp,  with  bands playing.  At  the  end  of \nthe  second  day's  battle,  the  Kauravas  were  \n\nin  the  mood  that  the  Pandavas  were  in  the  \nprevious evening.  \n",

      "content": "\nON  the  morning  of  the  third  day  Bhishma  \narrayed   his   army   in   eagle   formation   and \nhimself   led   it   while   Duryodhana   and   his \nforces  protected  the  rear.  So  great  was  the  \ncare    taken    over    every    detail    that    the \nKauravas  were  certain  that  there  could  be  \nno mishap for them that day.  \nThe   Pandavas   too   arrayed   their   forces \nwith           skill.           Dhananjaya           and \nDhrishtadyumna    decided    in    favor    of    a \ncrescent   formation   of   their   army   so   as \nmore   effectually   to   cope   with   the   eagle \nformation of the enemy's forces.  \nOn   the   right   horn   of   the   crescent   stood \nBhima  and  on  the  left  Arjuna,  leading  the \nrespective  divisions.  The  battle  began.  All \narms   were   at   once   engaged   and   blood \nflowed  in  torrents  and  the  dust  that  was \nraised   by   chariots,   horses   and   elephants \nrose to hide the sun.  \nDhananjaya's  attack  was  powerful  but  the \nenemy   stood   firm.   A   counter-attack   was \nmade   by   the   Kauravas   concentrating   on \nArjuna's  position.  Javelins  and  spears  and \nother   missiles   flew   in   the   air   shining   like \nforked lightning in a thunderstorm.  \nLike   a   great   cloud   of   locusts   the   shafts \ncovered     Arjuna's     chariot.     But     with \namazing     skill     he     raised     a     moving \nfortification     around     his     chariot     with \narrows   discharged   in   an   unending   stream \nfrom his famous bow.  \nAt  another  point  Sakuni  led  a  large  force \nagainst   Satyaki   and   Abhimanyu.   Satyaki's \nchariot  was  broken  to  pieces  and  he  had  to  \nscramble    up    Abhimanyu's    chariot    and \nthereafter    both    fought    from    the    same \nchariot.  \nThey  were  able  to  destroy  Sakuni's  forces.  \nDrona     and     Bhishma     jointly     attacked \nDharmaputra's   division   and   Nakula   and \nSahadeva  joined  their  brother  in  opposing \nDrona's offensive.  \nBhima   and   his   son   Ghatotkacha   attacked \nDuryodhana's   division   and   in   that   day's \nbattle  the  son  appeared  to  excel  his  great  \nfather in valor.  \nBhima's  shafts  hit  Duryodhana  and  he  lay \nin   swoon   in   his   chariot.   His   charioteer \nquickly   drove   the   chariot   away   from   the \nscene.  He  feared  that  the  Kaurava  forces \nwould   be   completely   demoralised   if   they \nsaw that the prince had been disabled.  \nBut    even    this    movement    created    great \nconfusion.   Bhimasena   took   full   advantage \nof  the  position  and  worked  havoc  among \nthe fleeing Kaurava forces. \nDrona     and     Bhishma     who     saw     the \ndiscomfiture      and      confusion      of      the \nKaurava    army    came    up    quickly    and \nrestored   confidence.   The   scattered   forces \nwere   brought   together   and   Duryodhana \nwas again seen leading them. \n\"How     can     you     stand     thus,\"     said \nDuryodhana  to  the  grandsire,  \"looking  on \nwhen  our  forces  are  scattered  and  put  to \ndisgraceful  flight?  I  fear  you  are  too  kind \nto  the  Pandavas.  Why  did  you  not  tell  me  \nfrankly        'I        love        the        Pandavas; \nDhrishtadyumna     and     Satyaki     are     my \nfriends  and  I  cannot  attack  or  slay  them.' \nYou    should    have    stated    the    position \nexplicitly  to  me.  Surely  these  men  are  not  \nequal  to  you.  And  if  you  were  so  minded,  \nyou   could   deal   with   them   easily.   Even \nnow,  it  would  be  best  if  you  and  Drona \ntold me frankly your mind in the matter.\" \nThe  chagrin  of  defeat,  and  the  knowledge \nthat  the  grandsire  disapproved  of  his  ways  \nmade  Duryodhana  speak  thus  bitterly.  But \nBhishma   merely   smiled   and   said:   \"Wasn't \nI  quite  frank  in  my  advice  to  you?  That \nadvice  you  rejected  when  you  decided  on \nwar.  I  tried  to  prevent  the  war  but,  now \nthat  it  has  come, I  am  fulfilling  my  duties  \nby   you   with   all   my   might.   I   am   an   old \nman   and   what   I   am   doing   is   quite   my \nutmost.\" \n\nSaying   thus,   the   grandsire   resumed   his \noperations.    The    turn    of    events    in    the \nforenoon  had  been  so  much  in  their  favor  \nthat   the   delighted   Pandavas   were   now \nsomewhat careless.  \nThey  did  not  expect  Bhishma  to  rally  his \nforces  and  attack  them  again.  But  stung  by  \nDuryodhana's    reproaches,    the    grandsire \nraged about the field like a destroying fire.  \nHe  rallied  his  men  and  delivered  the  most  \nsevere   attack   yet   made   on   the   Pandava \narmy.  The  latter  thought  that  the  grandsire  \nhad   multiplied   himself   into   a   number   of \nBhishmas   fighting   at   several   points.   So \nswift were his movements that afternoon.  \nThose    who    opposed    him    were    struck \ndown  and  perished  like  months  in  the  fire.  \nThe  Pandava  army  was  thoroughly  broken \nand   began   to   scatter.   Vasudeva,   Partha \nand  Sikhandin  tried  hard to  restore  order  \nand confidence, but were unsuccessful.  \n\"Dhanjaya,\"   said   Krishna,   \"now   has   the \ncritical    time    come.    Be    true    to    your \ndecision   not   to   flinch   from   your   duty   to \nkill   in   battle   Bhishma,   Drona   and   all   the \nother   friends   and   relatives   and   respected \nelders.   You   have   pledged   yourself   to   it \nand    you    have    now    to    carry    it    out. \nOtherwise    our    army    is    lost    beyond \nredemption.   You   must   now   attack   the \ngrandsire.\" \n\"Drive on,\" said Arjuna.  \nAs  Dhananjaya's  chariot  sped  on  towards \nBhishma,  it  met  a  hot  reception  from  the \ngrandsire, who covered it with his arrows.  \nBut,  Arjuna  bent  his  bow  and  discharged \nthree  shafts  that  broke  the  grandsire's  bow.  \nBhishma  picked  up  another  bow  but  it  too  \nmet   the   same   fate.   The   grandsire's   heart \nwas  gladdened  when  he  saw  Arjuna's  skill \nin archery. \n\"Hail,     brave     warrior!\"     applauded     the \ngrandsire,  even  as,  taking  up  another  bow;  \nhe  poured  shafts  on  Arjuna's  chariot  with \nunerring aim. \nKrishna  was  not  happy  at  the  way  Arjuna  \nmet  the  attack.  The  grandsire's  bow  was \nworking   fiercely.   But   Arjuna's   hands   did \nnot  do  their  best,  for  his  heart  was  not  in \nit.  \nHe   had   too   much   regard   for   his   great \ngrandsire.   Krishna   thought   that,   if   Arjuna \nwent   on   like   this,   the   army,   which   had \nbeen  so  badly  demoralized  already,  would  \nbe utterly destroyed and all would be lost.  \nKrishna   managed   the   chariot   skilfully,   but \nin  spite  of  it,  both  he  and  Arjuna  were  hit  \nmany times by Bhishma's arrows.  \nJanardana's   (Krishna)   anger   rose.   \"I   can \nstand   this   no   longer,   Arjuna.   I   shall   kill \nBhishma  myself  if  you  will  not  do  it!\"  he \nexclaimed,  and  dropping  the  reins,  he  took  \nup  his  discus  and  jumped  down  from  the \nchariot     and     dashed     forward     towards \nBhishma. \nBhishma  was  far  from  being  perturbed  at \nthis.   On   the   contrary,   his   face   expanded \nwith  ecstatic  joy.  \"Come,  come,  Oh  Lotus-\neyed One!\" he exclaimed.  \n\"I  bow  to  you,  Oh  Madhava.  Lord  of  the  \nWorld,  have  you  indeed  come  down  from \nthe  chariot  for  my  sake?  I  offer  you  my \nlife.   If   I   be   slain   by   you,   I   shall   be \nglorified  in  the  three  worlds.  Give  me  that  \nboon.  May  your  hands  take  this  life  away \nand save me for eternity.\" \nArjuna   was   distressed   to   see   this.   He \njumped    down    and    ran    after    Krishna. \nOvertaking   him   with   great   difficulty,   he \nentreated Krishna to turn back. \n\"Do    not    lose    your    patience    with    me. \nDesist   and   I   promise   not   to   flinch,\"   he \nsaid,  and  persuaded  Krishna  to  return.  The  \nchariot    reins    were    again    in    Krishna's \nhands.  Arjuna  attacked  the  Kaurava  forces  \nfuriously    and    thousands    were    slain    by \nhim. \nThe  Kauravas  suffered  a  severe  defeat  on \nthe   evening   of   the   third   day.   As   they \nreturned  to  their  camps  in  torchlight,  they \nsaid   to   one   another:   \"Who   can   equal \n\nArjuna?   There   is   nothing   strange   in   his \nbeing     victorious.\"     So     marvelous     was \nArjuna's prowess that day. \n",

Still,   the \ngreat   battle   is   the   central   event   in   the \nMahabharata  and,  if  we  skip  over  it,  we \ncannot  fully  understand  the  epic  heroes  of \nthat crowded stage.  \nAt   break   of   day,   Bhishma   arrayed   the \nKaurava    forces    again.    Surrounded    by \nDrona,     Duryodhana     and     others,     the \ngrandsire   looked   verily   like   great   Indra, \nholding   his   thunder   bolt,   surrounded   by \nthe devas.  \nThe    Kaurava    army,    with    its    chariots, \nelephants  and  horses  all  arrayed  in  battle \norder   and   ready   for   the   fight,   presented \nthe   appearance   of   the   sky   in   a   great \nthunderstorm. \nThe   grandsire   gave   orders   for   advance. \nArjuna    watched    the    hostile    movements \nfrom   his   chariot,   whereon   the   Hanuman \nflag was waving, and he too got ready.  \nThe     battle     commenced.     Aswatthama, \nBhurisravas,  Salya,  Chitrasena  and  the  son \nof    Chala    surrounded    Abhimanyu    and \nattacked   him.   The   warrior   fought   like   a \nlion opposing five elephants.  \nArjuna   saw   this   combined   attack   on   his \nson  and,  with  a  wrathful  lion  roar  joined \nhis   son   whereat   the   tempo   of   fighting \nflared    up.    Dhrishtadyumna    also    arrived \nwith  a  large  force.  The  son  of  Chala  was  \nkilled.  \nChala   himself   now   joined   and   he   with \nSalya,      made      a      strong     attack     on \nDhrishtadyumna.    The    latter's    bow    was \nsevered    into    two    by    a    sharp    missile \ndischarged by Salya. \nAbhimanyu  saw  this  and  sent  a  shower  of \narrows   on   Salya   and   put   him   in   such \ndanger   that   Duryodhana   and   his   brothers \nrushed   to   Salya's   help.   Bhimasena   also \nappeared on the scene at this juncture.  \nWhen    Bhima    raised    his    mace    aloft, \nDuryodhana's      brothers      lost      courage. \nDuryodhana,      who      saw      this,      was \nexceedingly       angry       and       immediately \ncharged  against  Bhima  with  a  large  force \nof elephants.  \nAs   soon   as   Bhima   saw   the   elephants \ncoming  up,  he  descended  from  his  chariot,  \niron   mace   in   hand,   attacked   them   so \nfiercely    that    they    scattered    in    a    wild \nstampede,    throwing    the    Kaurava    ranks \ninto disorder.  \nIt   will   be   seen   that   even   in   our   Puranic \nstories  elephants  fared  as  badly  in  battle  as  \nthey  did  in  the  wars  of  the  Greeks  and  the  \nRomans.   Bhima's   attack   on   the   elephants \nwas   like   Indra's   devastating   onslaught   on \nthe winged mountains.  \nThe  slaughtered  elephants  lay  dead  on  the  \nfield   like   great   hills.   Those   that   escaped \nfled in  panic  and  caused  great  havoc  in  the  \nKaurava      army,      trampling      numerous \nsoldiers   in   their   wild   race.   Duryodhana, \nthereupon,  ordered  a  wholesale  attack  on \nBhima.  \nBut  he  stood  firm  as  a  rock  and  presently,  \nthe  Pandava  warriors  came  up  and  joined  \nhim.   A   number   of   Duryodhana's   arrows \nstruck   Bhima's   chest   and   he   climbed   up \nhis chariot again.  \n\"Visoka,    now    is    the    glad    hour,\"    said \nBhima  to  his  charioteer.  \"I  see  a  number \nof  Dhritarashtra's  sons  before  me,  ready  to  \nbe  shaken  down  like  ripe  fruits  on  a  tree.  \nKeep   your   hold   well   on   the   reins   and \ndrive   on.   I   am   going   to   dispatch   these \nwretches    to    Yama's    abode.\"    Bhima's \narrows    would    have    killed    Duryodhana \nthen   and   there,   had   it   not   been   for   his \narmor.  \nEight  of  Duryodhana's  brothers  were  slain \nin  that  day's  battle  by  Bhima.  Duryodhana  \nfought      fiercely.      Bhima's      bow      was \nsmashed  by  one  of  Duryodhana's  arrows. \n\nTaking   up   a   fresh   bow,   Bhima   sent   an \narrow   with   a   knife-edge   at   Duryodhana \nthat cut the latter's bow into two.  \nNot  baffled  by  this,  Duryodhana  took  up  a  \nfresh   bow   and   discharged   a   well-aimed \nshaft   which   struck   Bhima   on   his   chest \nwith   such   force   that   he   reeled   and   sat \ndown.  \nThe  Pandava  warriors  now  poured  a  great  \nshower     of     arrows     on     Duryodhana. \nGhatotkacha,  who  saw  his  father  sit  dazed  \nwith     the     force     of     the     blow,     got \nexceedingly  angry  and  fell  on  the  Kaurava  \narmy,   which   was   unable   to   stand   against \nhis onslaught. \n\"We   cannot   fight   this   Rakshasa   today.\" \nsaid   Bhishma   to   Drona.   \"Our   men   are \nweary. It  is  nearing  sunset  and  at  night  of \nthe   Rakshasas   grows   stronger   with   the \ndarkness.   Let   us   deal   with   Ghatotkacha \ntomorrow.\" \nThe   grandsire   ordered   his   army   to   retire \nfor   the   night.

So,  they  win.  Your  sons  are  brave  \nbut   their   thoughts   are   wicked.   Therefore, \nluck  does  not  favor  them.  They  have  done  \ngreat  injustice  to  the  Pandavas,  and  they \nare  reaping  the  harvest  of  their  sins.  The \nPandavas   are   not   winning   by   charms   or \nmagic     incantations.     They     are     fighting \naccording   to   the   practice   of   kshatriyas. \nTheir  cause  being  just,  they  have  strength.  \nFriends   advised   you,   but   you   discarded \nwise    counsel.    Vidura, Bhishma,    Drona \nand   I   tried   to   stop   you   in   your   unwise \ncourse,   but   you   did   not   listen   and   you \nwent   on.   Like   a   foolish   sick   man   who \nrefuses    to    drink    bitter    medicine,    you \nobstinately   refused   to   follow   our   advice, \nwhich   would   have   saved   your   people, \npreferring    to    do    as    your    foolish    son \ndesired.   You   are   in   distress   now.   Last \nnight,    Duryodhana    asked    Bhishma    the \nsame  question  as  you  put  to  me  now.  And  \nBhishma  gave  the  same  answer  as  I  give \nyou.\" \nWhen   the   fighting   was   stopped   on   the \nevening   of   the   fourth   day,   Duryodhana \n\nwent   by   himself   to   Bhishma's   tent   and, \nbowing reverently, said: \n\"Grandsire,  the  world  knows  that  you  are \na  warrior  who  knows  not  fear.  The  same  is  \nthe  case  with  Drona,  Kripa,  Aswatthama, \nKritavarma,        Sudakshin,        Bhurisravas, \nVikarna   and   Bhagadatta.   Death   has   no \nterror   for   these   veterans.   There   is   no \ndoubt,  the  prowess  of  these  great  warriors  \nis   limitless,   even   like   your   own.   All   the \nPandavas  combined  cannot  defeat  any  one  \nof  you.  What  then  is  the  mystery  behind \nthis  daily  defeat  of  our  army  at  the  hands \nof the sons of Kunti?\" \nBhishma   replied:   \"Prince,   listen   to   me.   I \nhave  given  you  advice  on  every  occasion \nand  told  you  what  was  good  for  you.  But,  \nyou   have   always   refused   to   follow   what \nyour  elders  counselled  you  to  do.  Again,  I  \ntell   you   that   it   is   best   for  you  to  make \npeace  with  Pandu's  sons.  For  your  good  as  \nwell  as  for  that  of  the  world,  that  is  the \nonly    course    that    should    be    followed. \nBelonging   to   the   same   royal   house,   you \ncan  all  enjoy  this  vast  country  as  yours.  I  \ngave  you  this  advice,  but  you  disregarded \nit    and    have    grievously    wronged    the \nPandavas,  the  fruit  of  which  you  are  now \nreaping.   The   Pandavas   are   protected   by \nKrishna  himself.  How  then  can  you  hope \nfor  victory?  Even  now,  it  is  not  loo  late \nfor  making  peace  and  that  is  the  way  to \nrule   your   kingdom,  making  the  Pandavas, \nyour  powerful  brothers,  friends  instead  of \nenemies.   Destruction   awaits   you   if   you \ninsult   Dhananjaya   and   Krishna,   who   are \nnone other than Nara and Narayana.\" \nDuryodhana   took   leave   and   went   to   his \ntent, but he could not sleep that night. \nThe  battle  was  resumed  the  next  morning.  \nBhishma  arrayed  the  Kaurava  forces  in  a \nstrong   formation.   So   did   Dhrishtadyumna \nfor the Pandava army.  \nBhima  stood  at  the  head  of  the  advance \nlines       as       usual.       And       Sikhandin, \nDhrishtadyumna      and      Satyaki      stood \nbehind,   securely   guarding   the   main   body, \naided by other generals.  \nDharmaputra   and   the   twin   brothers   held \nthe    rear.    Bhishma    bent    his    bow    and \ndischarged   his   shafts.   The   Pandava   army \nsuffered     greatly     under     the     grandsire's \nattack. \nDhananjaya    saw    this    and    retaliated   by \nfierce       shafts       aimed       at       Bhishma. \nDuryodhana      went      to      Drona      and \ncomplained     bitterly     according     to     his \ncustom.  \nDrona   upbraided   him   severely:   \"Obstinate \nprince,    you    talk    without    understanding. \nYou     are     ignorant     of     the     Pandavas' \nstrength. We are doing our best.\"  \nDrona's   powerful   attack   on   the   Pandava \narmy  was  too  much  for  Satyaki  who  was  \nmeeting  it  and  Bhima  therefore  turned  his \nattentions    to    Drona.    The    battle    grew \nfiercer   still.   Drona,   Bhishma   and   Salya \nmade a combined attack on Bhima.  \nSikhandin   supported   Bhima   by   pouring   a \nshower  of  arrows  on  Bhishma.  As  soon  as  \nSikhandin    stepped    in,    Bhishma    turned \naway.  For  Sikhandin  was  born  a  girl,  and  \nBhishma's  principles  did  not  permit  him  to  \nattack a woman.  \nIn  the  end,  this  same  objection  proved  to  \nbe   the   cause   of Bhishma's   death.   When \nDrona     saw     Bhishma     turn     away,     he \nattacked  Sikhandin  fiercely  and  compelled \nhim to withdraw. \nThere  was  a  promiscuous  battle  the  whole  \nof   the   morning   of   the   fifth   day,   and   the \nslaughter   was   terrific.   In   the   after   noon, \nDuryodhana  sent  a large  force  to  oppose \nSatyaki.  \nBut   Satyaki   destroyed   it   completely   and \nadvanced        to        attack        Bhurisravas. \nBhurisravas,      who      was      a      powerful \nopponent,  put  Satyaki's  men  to  fight,  and \npressed  Satyaki  himself  so  fiercely  that  he  \nwas in distress.  \nSatyaki's  ten  sons  saw  their  father's  plight  \nand  sought  to  relieve  him  by  launching  an \n\noffensive       against       Bhurisravas,       but \nBhurisravas      undaunted      by      numbers, \nopposed  the  combined  attack  and  was  not  \nto  be  shaken.  His  well-aimed  darts  broke  \ntheir   weapons   and   they   were   all   slain, \nstrewn  on  the  field  like  so  many  tall  trees  \nstruck   down   by   lightning.   Satyaki,   wild \nwith   rage   and   grief,   drove   forward   at   a \nfurious pace to slay Bhurisravas.  \nThe   chariots   of   the   two   warriors   dashed \nagainst  each  other  and  crumbled  to  pieces.  \nAnd  the  warriors  stood  face  to  face  with \nsword    and    shield    in    desperate    single \ncombat. \nThen,  Bhima  came  and  took  away  Satyaki \nby  force  into  his  chariot  and  drove  away.  \nFor  Bhima  knew  that  Bhurisravas  was  an \nunrivalled  swordsman  and  he  did  not  want  \nSatyaki to be slain. \nArjuna   killed   thousands   of   warriors   that \nevening.   The   soldiers,   dispatched   against \nhim   by   Duryodhana,   perished   like   moths \nin   the   fire.   As   the   sun   went   down   and \nBhishma  gave  orders  to  cease  fighting,  the  \nprinces   on   the   Pandava   army   surrounded \nArjuna  and  greeted  him  with  loud  cries  of \nadmiration and victory. \nThe  armies  on  both  sides  retired  to  camp,  \nalong with the tired horses and elephants.  \n",

He   was \nattacked      by      Duhsasana,      Durvishaha, \nDurmata,      Jaya,      Jayatsena,      Vikarna, \nChitrasena,        Sudarsana,        Charuchitra, \nSuvarma,     Dushkarna     and     others,     all \ntogether.  \nBhimasena,  who  did  not  know  what  fear \nwas,  stood  up  and  fought  them  all.  They \ndesired  to  take  him  prisoner  and  he  to  kill \nthem all on the spot.  \nThe   battle   raged   fiercely,   even   like   the \nancient   battle   between   the   gods   and   the \nasuras.  Suddenly,  the  son  of  Pandu  lost  his  \npatience    and    jumped    down    from    his \nchariot,  mace  in  band,  and  made  straight \non   foot   for   the   sons   of   Dhritarashtra,   in \nhot haste to slay them. \nWhen      Dhrishtadyumna      saw      Bhima's \nchariot   disappear   in   the   enemy   lines,   he \nwas    alarmed    and    rushed    to    prevent \ndisaster.    He    reached    Bhima's    car,    but \nfound    it    was    occupied    only    by    the \ncharioteer  and  Bhima  was  not  in  it.  With \ntears  in  his  eyes,  he  asked  the  charioteer: \n\"Visoka,   where   is   Bhima   dearer   to   me \nthan      life?\"      Dhrishtadyumna      naturally \nthought Bhima had fallen. \n\nVisoka   bowed   and   said   to   the   son   of \nDrupada:  \"The  son  of  Pandu  asked  me  to  \nstay   here   and,   without   waiting   for   my \nreply   rushed   forward   on   foot,   mace   in \nhand, into the enemy ranks.\"  \nFearing       that       Bhima       would       be \noverpowered    and    killed    Dhrishtadyumna \ndrove   his   chariot   into   the   enemy   lines   in \nsearch   of   Bhimasena,   whose   path   was \nmarked by the bodies of slain elephants.  \nWhen   Dhrishtadyumna   found   Bhima,   he \nsaw    him    surrounded    on    all    sides    by \nenemies     fighting     from     their     chariots. \nBhima   stood   against   them   all,   mace   in \nhand, wounded all over and breathing fire.  \nDhrishtadyumna   embraced   him   and   took \nhim  into  his  chariot  and  proceeded  to  pick  \nout  the  shafts  that  had  stuck  in  his  body.  \nDuryodhana   now   ordered   his   warriors   to \nattack     Bhimasena     and     Dhrishtadyumna \nand   not   to   wait   for   them   to   attack   or \nchallenge.  \nAccordingly,     they     made     a     combined \nattack  even  though  they  were  not  inclined \nto   engage   themselves   in   further   fighting. \nDhrishtadyumna    had    a    secret    weapon, \nwhich  he  had  obtained  from  Dronacharya \nand,    discharging    it,    threw    the    enemy \nforces into a stupor.  \nBut  Duryodhana  then  joined  the  fray  and \ndischarged  weapons  to  counter  the  stupor \nweapons    of    Dhrishtadyumna.   Just   then, \nreinforcements      sent      by      Yudhishthira \narrived.  \nA    force    of    twelve    chariots    with    their \nretinue  led  by  Abhimanyu  came  upon  the \nscene to support Bhima.  \nDhrishtadyumna      was      greatly      relieved \nwhen  he  saw  this.  Bhimasena  had  also  by \nnow   refreshed   himself   and   was   ready   to \nrenew   the   fight.   He   got   into   Kekaya's \nchariot   and   took   up   his   position   along \nwith the rest.  \nDrona,  however,  was  terrible  that  day.  He  \nkilled     Dhrishtadyumna's     charioteer     and \nhorses    and    smashed    his    chariot    and \nDrupada's   son   had   to   seek   a   place   in \nAbhimanyu's    car.    The    Pandava    forces \nbegan  to  waver  and  Drona  was  cheered  by  \nthe Kaurava army. \nIndiscriminate   mass   fighting   and   slaughter \nwent  on  that  day.  At  one  time,  Bhima  and  \nDuryodhana   met   face   to   face.   The   usual \nexchange  of  hot  words  took  place  and  was  \nfollowed by a great battle of archery.  \nDuryodhana  was  hit  and  fell  unconscious. \nKripa   extricated   him   with   great   skill   and \ntook    him    away    in    his    own    chariot. \nBhishma   personally   arrived   at   the   spot \nnow  and  led  the  attack  and  scattered  the \nPandava forces.  \nThe   sun   was   sinking,   but   the   battle   was \ncontinued  for  an  hour  yet  and  the  fighting \nwas   fierce   and   many   thousands   perished. \nThen  the  day's  battle  ceased.  Yudhishthira \nwas  glad  that  Dhrishtadyumna  and  Bhima \nreturned to camp alive. \n",

Our  formations  are  broken  and  \nour    warriors    are    being    slain    in    large \nnumbers.    You    are    looking    on    doing \nnothing.\" \nThe   grandsire   soothed   Duryodhana   with \ncomforting words:  \n\"Why  do  you  let  yourself  be  disheartened?  \nHere    are    all    of    us,    Drona,    Salya, \nKritavarma,         Aswatthama,         Vikarna, \nBhagadatta,   Sakuni,   the   two   brothers   of \nAvanti,   the   Trigarta   chief,   the   king   of \nMagadha,   and   Kripacharya.   When   these \ngreat  warriors  are  here,  ready  to  give  up \ntheir   lives   for   you,   why   should   you   feel \ndownhearted?   Get   rid   of   this   mood   of \ndejection.\" \nSaying this, he issued orders for the day. \n\"See     there,\"     the     grandsire     said     to \nDuryodhana.    \"These    thousands    of   cars, \nhorses  and  horsemen,  great  war  elephants,  \n\nand    those    armed    foot    soldiers    from \nvarious  kingdoms  are  all  ready  to  fight  for  \nyou.    With    this    fine    army,    you    can \nvanquish even the gods.

Duryodhana   rubbed   it \nover    his    numerous    wounds    and    felt \nrelieved. \nHe   went   to   the   field,   heartened   by   the \ngrandsire's  words  of  confidence.  The  army \nwas  that  day  arrayed  in  circular  formation.  \nWith    each    war    elephant    were    seven \nchariots fully equipped. \nEach    chariot    was    supported    by    seven \nhorsemen.     To     each     horseman     were \nattached    ten    shield    bearers.    Everyone \nwore armor.  \nDuryodhana   stood   resplendent   like   Indra \nat   the   center   of   this   great   and   well-\nequipped   army.   Yudhishthira   arrayed   the \nPandava   army   in   vajravyuha.   This   day's \nbattle   was   fiercely   fought   simultaneously \nat many sectors.  \nBhishma     personally     opposed     Arjuna's \nattacks.   Drona   and   Virata   were   engaged \nwith     each     other     at     another     point. \nSikhandin   and   Aswatthama   fought   a   big \nbattle at another sector.  \nDuryodhana    and    Dhrishtadyumna    fought \nwith    each    other    at    yet    another    point. \nNakula  and  Sahadeva  attacked  their  uncle  \nSalya.      The      Avanti      kings      opposed \nYudhamanyu,    while    Bhimasena    opposed \nKritavarma,     Chitrasena,     Vikarna     and \nDurmarsha.  \nThere were      great      battles      between \nGhatotkacha    and    Bhagadatta,    between \nAlambasa        and        Satyaki,        between \nBhurisravas    and    Dhrishtaketu,    between \nYudhishthira    and    Srutayu    and    between \nChekitana and Kripa.  \nIn   the   battle   between   Drona   and   Virata, \nthe  latter  was  worsted  and  he  had  to  climb  \ninto  the  chariot  of  his  son  Sanga,  having \nlost     his     own     chariot,     horses     and \ncharioteer.  \nVirata's  sons  Uttara  and  Sveta  had  fallen \nin   the   first   day's   battle.   On   this   seventh \nday,  Sanga  also  was  slain  just  as  his  father  \ncame  up  to  his  side.  Sikhandin,  Drupada's  \nson, was defeated by Aswatthama.  \nHis  chariot  was  smashed  and  he  jumped \ndown  and  stood  sword  and  shield  in  hand.  \nAswatthama  aimed  his  shaft  at  his  sword \nand   broke   it.   Sikhandin   then   whirled   the \nbroken  sword  and  hurled  it  at  Aswatthama  \nwith  tremendous  force,  but  it  was  met  by \nAswatthama's arrow.  \nSikhandin,  badly  beaten,  got  into  Satyaki's  \nchariot   and   retired.   In   the   fight   between \nSatyaki  and  Alambasa,  the  former  had  the  \nworst   of   it   at   first   but   later   recovered \nground and Alambasa had to flee. \nIn  the  battle  between  Dhrishtadyumna  and \nDuryodhana,  the  horses  of  the  latter  were \nkilled    and    he    had    to    alight    from    his \nchariot.  He,  however,  continued  the  fight, \nsword  in  hand.  Sakuni  came  then  and  took  \nthe prince away in his chariot.  \nKritavarma    made    a    strong    attack    on \nBhima    but    was    worsted.    He    lost    his \nchariot    and    horses    and    acknowledging \ndefeat,   fled   towards   Sakuni's   car,   with \nBhima's    arrows    sticking    all    over    him, \nmaking     him     look     like     a     porcupine \nspeeding away in the forest. \nVinda    and    Anuvinda    of    Avanti    were \ndefeated     by     Yudhamanyu,     and     their \narmies      were      completely      destroyed. \nBhagadatta  attacked  Ghatotkacha  and  put \nto flight all his supporters.  \nBut,  alone,  Ghatotkacha  stood  and  fought \nbravely.  But  in  the  end,  he  too  had  to  save  \nhimself    by    flight, which    gladdened    the \nwhole Kaurava army. \nSalya    attacked    his    nephews.    Nakula's \nhorses  were  killed  and  he  had  to  join  his \nbrother     in     the     latter's     chariot.     Both \ncontinued   the   fight   from   the   same   car. \nSalya   was   hit   by   Sahadeva's   arrow   and \n\nswooned.   The   charioteer   skilfully   drove \nthe car away and saved Salya.  \nWhen   the   Madra   king   (Salya)   was   seen \nretreating    from    the    field    Duryodhana's \narmy  lost  heart  and  the  twin  sons  of  Madri  \nblew    their    conchs    in    triumph.    Taking \nadvantage   of   the   situation,   they   inflicted \nheavy damage on Salya's forces. \nAt   noon,   Yudhishthira   led   an   attack   on \nSrutayu.    The    latter's    well-aimed   arrows \nintercepted    Dharmaputra's    missiles,    and \nhis  armor  was  pierced  and  he  was  severely  \nwounded. \nYudhishthira  then  lost  his  temper  and  sent \na   powerful   arrow   that   pierced   Srutayu's \nbreast-plate.   That   day,   Yudhishthira   was \nnot his normal self and burnt with anger.  \nSrutayu's    charioteer    and    horses    were \nkilled  and  the  chariot  was  smashed  and  he  \nhad   to   flee   on   foot   from   the   field.   This \ncompleted        the        demorahsation        of \nDuryodhana's army.  \nIn  the  attack  on  Kripa,  Chekitana,  losing \nhis   chariot   and   charioteer,   alighted   and \nattacked    Kripa's    charioteer    and    horses \nwith mace in hand and killed them.  \nKripa   also   alighted,   and   standing   on   the \nground,   discharged   his   arrows.   Chekitana \nwas  badly  hit.  He  then  whirled  his  mace \nand  hurled  it  at  Kripacharya, but  the  latter  \nwas   able   to   intercept   it   with   his   own \narrow.  \nThereupon   they   closed   with   each   other, \nsword  in  hand.  Both  were  wounded  and \nfell  on  the  ground,  when  Bhima  came  and  \ntook Chekitana    away    in    his    chariot. \nSakuni    similarly    took    wounded    Kripa \naway in his car.  \nNinety-six   arrows   of   Dhrishtaketu   struck \nBhurisravas.   And   the   great   warrior   was \nlike  a  sun  radiating  glory,  as  the  arrows, \nall    sticking    in    his    breast-plate,    shone \nbright   around   his   radiant   face.   Even   in \nthat   condition,   he   compelled   Dhrishtaketu \nto   admit   defeat   and   retire.      Three   of \nDuryodhana's           brothers           attacked \nAbhimanyu   who   inflicted   a   heavy   defeat \non   them   but   spared   their   lives,   because \nBhima  had  sworn  to  kill  them.  Thereupon, \nBhishma attacked Abhimanyu. \nArjuna  saw  this  and  said  to  his  illustrious \ncharioteer:  \"Krishna,  drive  the  car  towards  \nBhishma.\" \nAt  that  moment,  the  other  Pandavas  also \njoined  Arjuna.  But  the  grandsire  was  able \nto   hold   his   own   against   all   five   until   the \nsunset,  and  the  battle  was  suspended  for \nthe  day.  And  the  warriors  of  both  sides, \nweary  and  wounded,  retired  to  their  tents \nfor    rest    and    for    having    their    injuries \nattended to. \nAfter   this,   for   an   hour,   soft   music   was \nplayed,  soothing  the  warriors  to  their  rest.  \nThat    hour    was    spent,    says    the    poet, \nwithout  a  word  about  war  or  hatred.  It  was  \nan   hour   of   heavenly   bliss,   and   it   was   a \nglad  sight  to  see.  One  can  see  herein  what  \nthe great lesson of the Mahabharata is. \n",

      "content": "\nWHEN   the   eighth   day   dawned, Bhishma \narrayed   his   army   in   tortoise   formation. \nYudhishthira said to Dhrishtadyumna: \n\"See  there,  the  enemy  is  in  kurma  vyuha \n(tortoise   formation).   You   have   to   answer \nat once with a formation that can break it.\" \nDhrishtadyumna     immediately     proceeded \nto   his   task.   The   Pandava   forces   were \narrayed in a three-pronged formation.  \nBhima   was   at   the   head   of   one   prong, \nSatyaki   of   another,   and   Yudhishthira   at \nthe    crest    of    the    middle    division.    Our \nancestors   had   developed   the   science   of \nwar very well.  \nIt   was   not   reduced to   writing   but   was \npreserved   by   tradition   in   the   families   of \nkshatriyas.     Armor     and     tactics     were \nemployed  suitably  to  meet  the  weapons  of \noffence   and   the   tactics   that   the   enemy \nused in those days. \nThe   Kurukshetra   battle   was   fought   some \nthousands  of  years  ago.  Reading  the  story \nof   the   battle   in   the   Mahabharata,   we \n\nshould    not,    having    the    practice    and \nincidents    of    modern    warfare    in    mind, \nreject  the  Mahabharata  narrative  as  mere \nmyth with no relation to fact.  \nOnly  about  a  century  and  a  half  ago,  the \nEnglish   admiral   Nelson   fought   great   sea \nbattles and won undying renown.  \nThe   weapons   used   and   the   vessels   that \nactually    took    part    in    Nelson's    battles, \nwould    seem    almost    weird    and    even \nridiculous    if    compared    with    those    of \nmodern naval warfare.  \nIf  a  hundred  and  fifty years  can  make  so  \nmuch  difference,  we  must  be  prepared  for  \nvery   strange   things   in   the   procedure   and \nevents  of  a  period,  so  long  back  as  that  of  \nthe Mahabharata war. \nAnother  matter  to  be  kept  in  mind  is  that  \nwe  cannot  expect,  in  the  books  of  poets \nand  literary  writers,  accurate  or  full  details  \nabout   weapons   and   tactics,   although   the \nnarrative may be of battles.  \nMilitary   affairs   were   in   ancient   times   the \nsole   concern   of   the   military   order,   the \nkshatriyas.   Their   culture and  their  training \nwere entirely their own charge.  \nThe  principles  and  the  secrets  of  warfare \nand   the   science   and   art   of   the   use   of \nmilitary  weapons  were  handed  down  from \ngeneration   to   generation   by   tradition   and \npersonal instruction.  \nThere    were    no    military    textbooks    and \nthere  was  not  any  place  for  them  in  the \nworks   of   poets   and   rishis.   If   a   modern \nnovel   deals   in   some   chapters   with   the \ntreatment  and  cure  of  a  sick  person,  we \ncan  not  expect  to  see  such  details  in  it  as  \nmight   interest   a   medical   man.   No   author \nwould   care,   even   if   he   were   able,   to \ninclude scientific details in his story.  \nSo,  we  cannot  hope  to  find  in  the  epic  of \nVyasa,    precise    details    as    to    what    is \ntortoise   formation   or   lotus   formation.   We \nhave  no  explanation  as  to  how  one  could,  \nby    discharging    a    continuous    stream    of \narrows,  build a  defence  around  himself  or  \nintercept   and   cut   missiles   in   transit,   or \nhow  one  could  be  living  when  pierced  all \nover  by  arrows,  or  how  far  the  armor  worn  \nby  the  soldiers  and  officers  could  protect \nthem   against   missiles   or   what   were   the \nambulance  arrangements  or  how  the  dead \nwere disposed of.  \nAll   these   things   appertaining   to   ancient \nwar,  however  interesting,  will  have  to  be \nin  the  realm  of  the  unknown  in  spite  of  the  \nvivid      narrative      we      have      in      the \nMahabharata epic. \nBhima   killed   eight   of   Dhritarashtra's   sons \nearly  in  the  battle  that  day.  Duryodhana's \nheart  lost  courage  before  this.  It  seemed  to  \nhis     friends     as     if     Bhimasena     would \ncomplete  his  revenge  this  very  day,  even \nas  he  swore  in  the  assembly  ball,  where \nthe great outrage was enacted.  \nArjuna   had   a   great   bereavement   in   this \nday's   battle.   His   dear   son   Iravan   was \nkilled.   This   son   of   Arjuna   by   his   Naga \nwife   had   come   and   joined   the   Pandava \nforces   at   Kurukshetra.   Duryodhana   sent \nhis    friend,    the    Rakshasa    Alambasa,    to \noppose the Naga warrior. \nIravan  was  slain  after  a  fierce  fight.  When \nArjuna     heard     this,     he     broke     down \ncompletely.   Said   he   turning   to   Vasudeva: \n\"Vidura   had   indeed   told   us   plainly   that \nboth    sides    would    be    plunged    in    grief \nunbearable.   What   are   we   doing   all   this \nwretched   destruction   up   on   one   another \nfor? Just  for  the  sake  of  property.  After  all  \nthis  killing,  what  joy  are  we  or  they  likely \nto  find  in  the  end?  O  Madhusudana,  I  now  \nsee   why   the   far   seeing   Yudhishthira   said \nhe  would  be  content  if  Duryodhana  would  \ngive      five      villages      to      us,      keeping \neverything   else   to   himself   and   he   would \nnot  resort  to  fighting  if  that  were  agreed \nto.    Duryodhana,    in    his    obstinate    folly, \nrefused   to   give   even   these   five   villages \nand    so,    these    great    sins    have    to    be \ncommitted    on    both    sides.    I    continue \nfighting      only      because      men      would \n\notherwise  think  me  a  coward,  who  could \nsubmit  tamely  to  wrong.  When  I  see  the \ndead  warriors  lying  on  the  field,  my  heart \nis  filled  with  unbearable  anguish.  Oh,  how \nwicked    we    are    to    carry    on    in    this \nmiserable, sinful way.\" \nSeeing   Iravan   killed,   Ghatotkacha   uttered \na    loud    war-cry    which    made    all    the \nassembled   soldiers   tremble.   And   with   his \ndivision,   he   fell   upon   the   Kaurava   army \nferociously.   So   great   was   the   destruction \nhe    wrought    that    at    many    points    the \nKaurava formation was broken.  \nSeeing  this,  Duryodhana  personally  led  an \nattack  on  Bhima's  son.  The  king  of  Vanga  \njoined    Duryodhana    with    his    elephants. \nDuryodhana   fought   most   bravely   on   this \neighth  day  of  the  battle.  He  killed  a  great  \nnumber of warriors on Ghatotkacha's side.  \nGhatotkacha  hurled  a  javelin  which  would \nhave   ended   Duryodhana's   career   but   for \nthe    Vanga    chief's    prompt    intervention \nwith one of his elephants.  \nThe  missile  hit  the  beast,  which  fell  dead, \nand Duryodhana was saved.  \nBhishma   was   anxious   about   Duryodhana \nand   sent   a   large   force   under   Drona   to \nsupport the Kaurava prince.  \nMany  were  the  veterans  who  were  in  this  \nforce that attacked Ghatotkacha.  \nSo  tumultuous  and  fierce  was  the  fight  at \nthis   sector   of   the   battle   that   Yudhishthira \nfeared   for   Ghatotkacha's   safety   and   sent \nBhimasena to his aid.  \nThen  the  battle  became  even  fiercer  than \nbefore.   Sixteen   of   Duryodhana's   brothers \nperished on this day. \n",

He \nuttered   words   that   were   like   the   sharp \nspears   and   pained   the   grandsire   greatly \nbut the latter was patient and said sadly: \n\"Like   ghee   on   the   sacrificial   fire   I   am \npouring  my  life  out  for  you.  Why  do  you \nseek  to  mortify  me,  who  have  been  doing \nmy  very  utmost  for  you?

This   is \nalso   the   plain   path   of   duty.   It   is   not \npossible   for   me   to   fight  Sikhandin,  for  I \ncan  never  raise  my  hand  against  a  woman.  \nNor    can    I    with    my    hands    kill    the \nPandavas,  for  my  mind  revolts  against  it.

He   sent   for \nDuhsasana  and  said  to  him:  \"Brother,  put \nforth  all  our  strength  in  today's  battle.  I  am  \nconvinced,  the  grandsire  is  fighting  on  our \nside    with    his    whole    heart.    It    is    only \nagainst  Sikhandin,  he  says,  he  cannot  use \nhis  weapons.  We  should  see  that  he  is  not  \nexposed   to   Sikhandin's   attacks,   for   you \nknow,  even  a  wild  dog  can  kill  a  lion  if \nthe latter scorns to fight back.\" \nThere     was     a     great     fight     between \nAbhimanyu     and     Alambasa.     Abhimanyu \ndemonstrated   that   his   valor   was   no   less \nthan   his   illustrious   father's.   Alambasa   had \nto flee on foot to save himself.  \nThere     were     fierce     combats     between \nSatyaki    and    Aswatthama    and    between \nDrona    and    Arjuna.    Thereafter,    all    the \nPandavas    attacked    the    grandsire    and \n\nDuryodhana   sent   Duhsasana   to   support \nthe   old   warrior.   Bhishma   fought   furiously \nand beat the Pandavas back.  \nThe    Pandava    forces    were    thoroughly \ndemoralised   and   were   flying   hither   and \nthither,  like  cattle  that  had  lost  their  way \nin the forest.  \nKrishna   halted   the   chariot   and   said   to \nArjuna:   \"Partha,   you   and   your   brothers \nwere   looking   forward   to   this   day,   after \nthirteen  years.  Do  not  hesitate  to  kill  the \ngrandsire.    Remember    the    duty    of    a \nsoldier.\" \nArjuna   bent   his   head   down   and,   without \nlooking  up,  replied:  \"I  would  much  rather \nhave  continued  to  be  an  exile  in  the  forest  \nthan   kill   the   grandsire   and   the   teachers \nwhom  I  love,  but  I  shall  obey  you.  Drive  \non.\" \nArjuna's    heart    was    not    in    the    fight. \nUnwillingly   and   in   great   distress   of   mind, \nhe  proceeded  to  the  combat.  Bhishma,  on \nthe   other   hand,   burnt   fiercely   like   the \nnoonday sun. \nWhen    the    army    saw    Arjuna's    chariot \nproceed    towards    Bhishma,    it    regained \ncourage   and   order   once   again   prevailed. \nBhishma's  arrows  came  thick  and  fast  and  \ncovered      the      advancing      chariot      so \ncompletely      that      neither      horses      nor \nvehicles could be seen.  \nKrishna   was   unperturbed   and   drove   on \nwith    circumspection    and    skill.    Arjuna's \nshafts  hit  Bhishma's  bow  and  shattered  it \nmany   times.   But   the   grandsire   went   on \nrenewing his weapon. \n\"You   are   not   fighting,   Arjuna,   as   you \nshould!\"   exclaimed   Krishna,   and   jumped \ndown   in   a   rage   from   the   chariot   and, \ntaking  up  his  discus,  he  advanced  towards  \nthe grandsire.  \nBhishma saw Vasudeva approaching. \n\"Hail,    O    Lotus-eyed    One!\"    he    cried. \n\"Blessed  am  I  to  be  separated  from  the \nbody by you! Come, come!\"  \nArjuna    jumped    down    from   the   chariot \nand,   rushing   forward   overtook   and   held \nKrishna,    casting    both    his    arms    around \nhim.   \"Stop,   Krishna,\"   he   cried.   \"Do   not \nbreak  your  pledge.  You  have  promised  not  \nto  use  weapons  in  this  battle.  This  is  my \nwork.   I   shall   not   fail.   I   shall   send   my \narrows    and    kill    the    beloved    grandsire \nmyself.  Pray,  mount  the  car  and  take  the \nreins.\" \nArjuna  took  Krishna  back  and  the  battle \nwas   resumed.   The   Pandava   forces   had \nbeen   handled   roughly,   but   now   the   sun \nwas   down   in   the   west   and   the   fighting \nended for the day. \n",

      "content": "\nIT  was  the  tenth  day  of  the  battle.  Keeping  \nSikhandin  in  front  of  him,  Arjuna  attacked  \nBhishma.   When   Sikhandin's   darts   pierced \nhis  breast,  sparks  flew  from  the  grandsire's  \neyes.  \nFor  a  moment  the  old  warrior's  anger  rose  \nlike  flaming  fire  and  his  eyes  glared  as  if \nto   consume   Sikhandin.   But,   at   once,   the \ngrandsire restrained himself.  \nHe   decided   not   to   be   provoked   into \nfighting    Sikhandin,    who    was    born    a \nwoman   and   to   strike   whom   it   seemed \nunworthy of a warrior. \nHe  knew,  however,  his  end  was  near  and  \ncalmed     himself.     Sikhandin     went     on \ndischarging   his   arrows,   not   minding   the \nbattle of emotions in his opponent's mind.  \nArjuna   also   steeled   his   heart,   and   from \nbehind    Sikhandin    aimed    arrows    at    the \nweak   points   in   Bhishma's   armor,   even \nwhile the grandsire stood still. \nBhishma   smiled   as   the   arrows   continued \nto  come  down  thick  on  him,  and  turning  to  \nDuhsasana,   said:   \"Ah,   these   are   Arjuna's \narrows!  These  cannot  be  Sikhandin's,  for \nthey   burn   my   flesh   as   the   crab's   young \nones tear their mother's body.\"  \nThus  did  the  grandsire  look  upon  his  dear  \npupil's   arrows   and,   while   saying   this   to \nDuhsasana,   he   took   up   a   javelin   and \n\nhurled   it   at   Arjuna.   Arjuna   met   it   with \nthree  arrows  which  cut  it  to  pieces    even \nas it was speeding through the air.  \nBhishma  then  decided  to  end  the  combat \nand   made   as   if   to   dismount   from   his \nchariot,   sword   and   shield   in   hand.   But \nbefore  he  could  do  so,  his  shield  was  cut  \nto pieces by Arjuna's arrows.  \nWith  arrows  sticking  all  over  his  body  so \nthickly  that  there  was  not  even  an  inch  of  \nintervening   space,   Bhishma   fell   headlong \nto the ground from his chariot.  \nAs  he  fell,  the  gods,  who  looked  on  from \nabove,    folded    their    hands    in    reverent \nsalutation  and  a  gentle  breeze,  laden  with \nfragrance  and  cool  raindrops,  swept  over \nthe battlefield. \nThus  fell  the  great  and  good  Bhishma,  the  \nson   of   Ganga,   who   came   on   earth   to \nhallow it and all it bears.  \nThe   blameless   hero   who,   unasked,   made \nthe   great   renunciation   to   give   joy   to   his \nfather.  The  undefeated  bowman  who  had \nhumbled   the   pride   of   Rama   of   the   axe. \nThe    selfless    worker    for    righteousness' \nsake,  thus  repaid  his  debt  to  Duryodhana,  \nand  lay  wounded  to  death  sanctifying  with \nhis     life-blood    the    battlefield.    As    the \ngrandsire  fell,  the  hearts  of  the  Kauravas \nalso fell along with him. \nBhishma's  body did  not  touch  the  ground,  \non  account  of  the  arrows  sticking  out  all \nover   his   body.   His   body   shone   more \nbrightly  than  ever  before,  as  it  lay  as  on  a  \nbed  of  honor,  supported  by  the  shafts  that  \nhad pierced his flesh.  \nBoth   armies   ceased   fighting   and   all   the \nwarriors  came  running  and  crowded  round  \nthe   great   hero,   who   lay   on   his   bed   of \narrows.  The  kings  of  the  earth  stood  with \nbowed   heads   round   him,   as   the   gods \nround Brahma. \n\"My  head  hangs  down  unsupported,\"  said \nthe  grandsire.  The  princes  who  stood  near,  \nran  and  brought  cushions.  The  old  warrior  \nrejected   them   with   a   smile   and,   turning \ntowards   Arjuna   said:   \"Dear   son   Partha, \ngive me a cushion befitting a warrior.\" \nWhen   Arjuna,   whose   arrows   were   just \nthen   burning   the   grandsire's   flesh,   heard \nthose   words   addressed   to   him,   he   took \nthree  arrows  from  out  of  his  quiver  and  so  \nplaced    them    that    the    grandsire's head \nfound support on their points.  \n\"Princes,\"    said    Bhishma    addressing    the \nassembled   chiefs,   \"Arjuna's   arrows   were \nindeed   what   my   head   required   to   be \nsupported    on. This    pillow    gives    me \nsatisfaction.  Now,  I  must  lie  thus  until  the \nsun   turns   north.   My   soul   will   not   depart \ntill  then.  When  I  pass  away,  those  of  you \nwho  may  be  alive  then  may  come  and  see  \nme.\" \nThen  the  grandsire  turned  again  to  Arjuna \nand  said:  \"I  am  tormented  with  thirst.  Get  \nme  some  drinking  water.\"  At  once,  Arjuna  \nraised  his  bow,  and  drawing,  it  to  the  ear,  \nshot  a  shaft  down  into  the  earth  near  the \ngrandsire on his right side. \nUpon   the   opening   made   by   the   arrow, \nthere  gushed  a  stream  of  pure  sweet  water  \nto  the  very  lips  of  the  dying  man.  Ganga \ncame  up,  says  the  poet,  to  quench  her  dear  \nson's   burning   thirst.   Bhishma   drank   and \nwas happy. \n\"Duryodhana,    may    you    be    wise!\"    said \nBhishma,   addressing   the   Kaurava   prince. \n\"Did   you   see   how   Arjuna   brought   me \nwater   to   quench   my   thirst?   Who   else   in \nthis   world   can   do   such   a   deed?   Make \npeace    with    him    without    further    delay. \nMay  the  war  cease  with  my  exit.  Listen  to  \nme, son, make peace with the Pandavas.\" \nThe    grandsire's    words    did    not    please \nDuryodhana.     Even     when     dying,     the \npatient  does  not  like  medicine.  He  objects  \nto  the  bitter  taste.  All  the  princes  retired  to  \ntheir camps. \n",

Radha's   son,   who, \nthrough    no    fault    of    his,    incurred    your \ngreat      displeasure,      humbly      prostrates \nhimself before you.\" \nWhen  after  humble  salutation  Karna  stood  \nup,  the  grandsire,  greatly  moved,  tenderly \nplaced   his   hand   on   Karna's   head   and \nblessed him. \n\"You  are  not  Radha's  son,  young  man,\"  he  \nsaid  in  loving  tones:  \"You  are  Kuntidevi's \nown  first  born.  Narada,  who  knows  all  the  \nsecrets  of  the  world,  himself  revealed  this \nto  me.  Son  of  Surya,  truly  I  entertained  no  \ndislike  for  you.  But  I  was  grieved  to  see \nyour   increasing   hatred   of   the   Pandavas \nalthough  they  gave  you  no  cause  for  it.  I \nknow   and   admire   your   valor   and   your \nopen   handedness.   And   I   know   also   that \nyou  belong  to  the  class  of  Phalguna  and \nKrishna  in  prowess.  It  is  proper  that  you \nbefriend   the   Pandavas.   Therein   lies   the \nright  path  for  you  who  are  their  brother. \nWith   the   closing   of   my   part   in   this   war, \nmay  the  chapter  of  your  enmity  also  close.  \nThis is my wish, Karna.\"  \nKarna    listened    respectfully    and    replied: \n\"Grandsire  I  know  I  am  Kunti's  son,  and \nnot   charioteer   born.   But   I   have   eaten \nDuryodhana's   salt   and   must   be   true   to \nhim,  to  be  true  to  my  own  lineage.  It  is \nimpossible   for   me   to   go   over   to   the \nPandavas   now.   You   must   permit   me   to \nrepay  with  my  life,  if  it  so  be  the  debt  I \nowe  to  Duryodhana  for  his  love  and  trust.  \nI   have   erred   greatly   in   word   and   deed. \nYou   must   forgive   me   for   it   all   and   give \nme your blessings.\" \nThe  great  acharya,  who  knew  all  the  laws  \nof   right   conduct   and   what   Karna   said, \nreplied:   \"Do   reflect   for   a   while   and   then \ndo as you wish, for that is the right way.\" \nEven      when      Bhishma      was      mortally \nwounded  and  lay  dying,  the  battle  did  not  \ncease.  Discarding  the  grandsire's  words  of \nwisdom, the Kauravas resumed the battle. \nDeprived    of    Bhishma's    leadership,    the \nKaurava   forces   felt   like   sheep   without   a \nshepherd   when   Bhishma   no   longer   led \nthem.    Indeed,    even    as    Bhishma    fell \nwounded, the men shouted: \n\"O  Karna,  you  are  the  one  left  to  lead  and  \nprotect us.\"  \nThe   Kaurava   warriors   felt   that,   if   but \nKarna    would    agree    to    take    up    the \ncommand,  victory  was  certain.  During  the \nfirst    ten    days    when    Bhishma    led    the \nforces,  the  son  of  Surya  kept  away  from \nthe battle.  \nAs   already   narrated,   deeply   hurt   at   the \ngrandsire's  contempt,  Karna  had  said:  \"So \nlong  as  you  are  up  fighting,  I  shall  keep \naloof.  If  you  slay  the  Pandavas  and  bring \nvictory   to   Duryodhana,   I   shall   be   glad. \nAnd  I  shall  then,  taking  the  king's  leave, \ngo  to  the  forest.  But,  if  you  be  defeated \nand  go  to  the  abode  of  the  brave,  I  who  \nam   not   deemed   by   you   as   an   adhiratha \n(master   of   chariot   warfare)   will   ride   my \nchariot  and  oppose  those  whom  you  deem  \nto  be  of  greater  prowess  than  myself.  And  \ndefeating       them,       bring       victory       to \nDuryodhana.\" \nThus     had     Karna     sworn     and,     with \nDuryodhana's  consent,  kept  aloof  from  the  \nbattle   during   the   first   ten   days.   Now   he \nwent  on  foot  to  Bhishma  who  lay  on  his \nbed   of   arrows   waiting   for   his   end   and, \nsaluting him, addressed him thus:  \n\"Veteran       grandsire,       vanquisher       of \nParasurama,  you  lie  on  the  field  of  battle, \nstruck   down   by   Sikhandin.   If   you,   who \nhad  reached  the  summit  of  right  living  and  \nwere  an  embodiment  of  purity  itself,  must \nlie  wounded  in  this  manner,  it  is  clear  that  \nno   one   can   attain   in   this   world   what   he \ndeserves  by  his  merit.  You  were  the  one \nboat    on    which    the    Kaurava    princes \ndepended   for   crossing   the   flood   of   their \ntroubles.  Heavy  indeed  will  be  the  blows \nthat   the   Pandavas   will   now   deal   at   the \nKauravas     and     great     will     be     their \n\nconsequent   distress.   Like   fire   and   wind \nburning    down    the    forest,    Arjuna    and \nKrishna     will     destroy     the     army     of \nKauravas.    This    is    certain.    Turn    your \ngracious   eyes  on  me  and  bless  me,  who \nhave    accepted    the    command    of    the \nforces.\" \nBhishma       gave       his       blessings       to \nKarna.\"You  are  like  the  good  earth  to  the  \nseeds,   like   rain   clouds   to   living   beings, \never    dependable,    firm    in    your    loyalty. \nServe   Duryodhana   and   save   him.   You \nvanquished   the   Kambojas   for   him.   You \nput   down   the   Kiratas   of   the   Himalayan \nfastnesses     for     him.     You     fought     the \nGirivrajas    on    his    behalf    and    defeated \nthem.     Many     more     things     you     have \naccomplished  for  him.  Take  charge  of  the \nKaurava   army   now   as   your   own   rich \npossession   and   guard   it   well.   May   you \nlead  Duryodhana's  forces  to  success!  May \nyou  have  every  good  fortune!  Fight  your \nenemies, go.\"  \nKarna,  having  received  the  benediction  of \nthe   grandsire,   mounted   his   chariot   and \nrode  to  the  battlefield.  When  the  valorous \nKarna  entered  the  field  on  his  war  chariot,  \nDuryodhana's   joys   knew   no   bounds.   His \nsorrow,   at   having   lost   Bhishma,   was   in \nsome degree alleviated.  \n",

So,   my   advice   is   that   we   install \nDronacharya,    the    teacher    of    all    these \nprinces      and      warriors,      as      supreme \ncommander.  He  indeed  is  the  greatest  of \nall    those    that    carry    arms    today.    No \nkshatriya    equals    him    in    the    qualities \nrequired   for   leading   our   army.   Let   us \ntherefore install him.\" \nDuryodhana  agreed  that  this  was  the  right \nthing to do, and so it was decided. \nDuryodhana  went  to  Dronacharya  and,  in \nthe   presence   of   the   assembled   warriors \nand princes, bowed and addressed him:  \n\"Revered     Master,     you     are     unrivalled \namong  all  those  assembled  here  in  caste, \nancestry,    knowledge    of    sciences,    age, \nwisdom,  valor  and  skill.  I  beg  of  you  to \naccept  the  supreme  command.  Under  your  \ncommand,   this   army   will   be   victorious.\" \nThe      assembled      kings      received      this \nproposal   with   loud   cheers   and   war   cries \nthat gladdened Duryodhana's heart. \nDrona   was   installed   in   due   form   amidst \nthunderous    acclamation.    The    praise    of \ncourtiers   and   the   sound   of   trumpets   that \naccompanied    the    ceremony,    made    the \nKauravas  feel  as  though  they  had  already \nvanquished  the  enemy.  So  great  was  their \nenthusiasm    and    confidence    in    Drona's \nleadership.  \nDrona     arrayed     the     army     in     circular \nformation.  Karna,  who  had  till  then  stood \naside  was  now  seen  moving  about  in  his \ngreat  chariot  on  the  battlefield  and  this  put  \nnew  courage  and  joy  into  the  hearts  of  the  \nKaurava soldiers.  \nThe  talk  went  round  in  the  army  that  the  \ngreat   Bhishma   did   not   wish   to   slay   the \nsons  of  Pandu  and  therefore  had  not  put \nhis  whole  heart  in  the  fight.  But  now  that \nKarna  was  in  the  field,  it  was  certain  that  \nthe Pandavas would be destroyed.  \nDronacharya   was   in   command   for   five \ndays   of   the   battle.   Though   of   advanced \nyears,  he  was  everywhere  in  the  field  and  \ndisplayed   the   fierce   energy   of   a   young \nwarrior.   Whenever   he   led   an   attack,   the \n\nPandava  forces  were  scattered  like  clouds  \nbefore a storm.  \nHe     personally     engaged     the     greatest \nwarriors  on  the  Pandava  side  in  battle.  He  \nfought         Satyaki,         Bhima,         Arjuna, \nDhrishtadyumna,      Abhimanyu,      Drupada \nand  Kasiraja  and  defeated  them  on  many \noccasions.  \nHe      harassed      and      inflicted      severe \npunishment   on   the   Pandava   army   during \nthe five days he was in command. \n",

      "content": "\nALIVE \nAS  SOON  AS  Drona  assumed  command  \nof  the  Kaurava  forces  Duryodhana,  Karna  \nand  Duhsasana  sat  in  council  and  decided  \non    a    plan.    And    Duryodhana    went    to \nDronacharya to put it in operation. \n\"Acharya,    we    desire    that    you    should \ncapture   Yudhishthira   alive   and   give   him \nover  to  us.  We  desire  nothing  more,  not \neven  a  total  victory.  If  you  achieve  this  for  \nus,   we   shall   all   be   exceedingly   satisfied \nwith your conduct of the war.\" \nWhen   Drona   heard   Duryodhana   address \nhim  thus,  great  was  his  joy,  for  he  hated \nthe    very    idea    of    slaying    the    Pandava \nbrothers.     Even     though,     to     fulfil     his \nobligation,   the   acharya   loyally   joined   the \nKaurava   side   against   the   Pandavas,   he \nloved  the  sons  of  Kunti  and  especially  the  \npure-minded Yudhishthira.  \nSo,   when   he   heard   Duryodhana   request \nthat     Yudhishthira     should     be     captured \nalive, he felt greatly relieved.  \n\"Duryodhana,   may   you   be   blessed!\"   the \nacharya  said.  \"Do  you  too  wish  to  abstain \nfrom      killing      Yudhishthira?      How      it \ngladdens   my   heart!   Truly,   Yudhishthira   is \none    without    an    enemy    and    the    name \nAjatasatru,  which  the  people  have  given  to  \nKunti's   eldest   son,   has   been   justified   by \nyour  great  decision.  When  even  you  have \nmade  up  your  mind  that  he  should  not  be  \nkilled   but   should   be   captured   alive,   his \nunrivalled    glory    has    become    ten    times \nenhanced.\" \n\"I    see,    dear    Duryodhana,    what    you \nintend,\"   Drona   continued.   \"You   wish   to \ndefeat  the  Pandavas  in  battle  and  then  give  \nthem  their  share  in  the  kingdom  and  live \nin  peace  and  amity  with  them.  I  see  this \nclearly     from     your     desire    to    capture \nYudhishthira alive.\" \nDrona   was   exceedingly   glad   and   he   said \nagain:   \"Indeed   Yudhishthira   is   the   most \nfortunate   man   on   earth.   The   gods   are \nshowering   their   favors   on   Kunti's   good \nson.   So   has   he   won   the   hearts   of   even \nenemies.\" \nBut   Duryodhana's   motives   in   wishing   to \ntake  Yudhishthira  alive  were  far  different. \nAnd   as   soon   as   Drona   acceded   to   his \nproposal   and   gave   his   pledge   that   he \nwould  do  his  best  to  capture  Yudhishthira,  \nhe began to reveal his real intentions. \nIf   Yudhishthira   were   slain,   nothing   would \nbe   gained   by   it,   and   the   anger   of   the \nPandavas   would   be   all   the   greater.   The \nbattle    would    rage    more    fiercely    than \nbefore.    And    Duryodhana    knew    that    it \nwould   only   mean   the   utter   defeat   of   his \narmy.  \nEven   if   the   fight   were   to   be   continued \nrelentlessly until      both      armies      were \ndestroyed,    Krishna    would    still    remain \nalive  and  he  would  put  either  Draupadi  or  \nKunti    in    sovereign    possession    of    the \nkingdom.  \nWhat    then    was    the    point    in    killing \nYudhishthira?    On    the    other    hand,    if \nYudhishthira        was        captured        alive, \nDuryodhana   thought,   the   war   would   end \nmore    speedily    and    victoriously    for    the \nKauravas.  \nThereafter,    he    could    surely    play    on \nYudhishthira's  goodness  and  his  loyalty  to \nthe   traditional   code   of   kshatriya   conduct. \nIt  was  pretty  certain  he  could  be  drawn \ninto  the  battle  of  dice  again  and  sent  to  the  \nforests once more.  \n\nTen  days  of  fighting  had  demonstrated  to \nDuryodhana    that    further    fighting    would \nonly  result  in  the  destruction  of  the  race, \nnot the fulfilment of the desires. \nWhen  Duryodhana  made  his  motives  clear  \nto     Drona,     the     acharya     was     greatly \ndisappointed  and  he  cursed  Duryodhana  in \nhis  heart.  But  whatever  the  reason  for  it, \nhe  was  glad  that  Yudhishthira  was  not  to \nbe killed. \nThe  news  that  Drona  had  given  a  solemn \nassurance   to   Duryodhana   that   he   would \ntake   Yudhishthir   a   prisoner,   was   carried \nby their spies to the Pandava army.  \nThe    Pandavas    knew    that,    when    the \nacharya  was  determined  on  something  and  \ngave  his  pledged  word  for  executing  it,  his  \nunrivalled  eminence  in  the  art  of  war  and \nhis valor made it a most serious affair.  \nSo,  they  soon  got  busy  and  so  arrayed  the  \nforces   that   Yudhishthira   was   never   left \nunsupported.   Whatever   movements   might \ntake  place,  they  always  took  care  to  leave  \nsufficient   protection   against   any   surprise \nattack on Yudhishthira. \nIn     the     first    day's    battle    under    the \nleadership   of   Drona,   the   acharya   amply \ndemonstrated   his   great   skill   and   energy. \nHe   moved   about   destroying   the   Pandava \nforces  like  a  fire  burning  up  dry  logs.  His  \nrapid  movements  made  the  Pandava  army \nfeel   as   if   Drona   was   everywhere at   the \nsame  time  showering  arrows  like  rain  and \nconverting   the   battlefield   into   a   stage   for \nthe  dance  of  the  God  of  Death.  He  cut  the  \nPandava       army       in       twain       where \nDhrishtadyumna stood.  \nMany   were   the   single   combats   among \nrenowned   warriors.   There   was   a   fierce \nbattle    between    Sahadeva    and    Sakuni \nskilled    in    illusion    warfare.    When    their \nchariots    broke,    they    alighted    on    the \nground.  And,  like  two  hills  sprung  to  life \nand   motion,   they   struck   each   other   with \nmaces   and   closed   with   one   another   in \nsingle     combat.     Between     Bhima     and \nVivimsati    there    was    a    great    battle    in \nwhich  chariots  were  broken  on  both  sides.  \nSalya    fought    his    nephew    Nakula    and \nharassed    him    exceedingly,    smiling    most \nprovokingly  all  the  time.  But,  in  the  end, \nSalya   had   his   car   smashed   and   his   flag \nbrought  down,  and  he  withdrew  admitting \ndefeat.       Between       Kripacharya       and \nDhrishtaketu   there   was   a   battle   in   which \nthe latter was worsted.  \nSo  also  was  there  fierce  fighting  between \nSatyaki    and    Kritavarma    and    between \nVirata  and  Karna.  Abhimanyu's  valor  was \nalso   demonstrated   as   he   fought   Paurava, \nKritavarma,   Jayadratha   and   Salya   single-\nhanded and made them withdraw.  \nThen  there  was  a  great  combat  between \nSalya  and  Bhimasena  in  which  Salya  was \ndefeated  and  made  to  retire.  The  Kaurava  \nforces   began   to   lose   courage   and   the \nPandava  army,  who  saw  this,  attacked  the  \nKaurava   army   with   renewed   energy   and \nbroke its ranks. \n When   Drona   saw   this,   he   decided   to \nrestore   lost   morale   by   leading   a   straight \nattack  on  Yudhishthira.  His  golden  chariot \nwent  forward,  drawn  by  four  noble  Sindhu \nhorses,   in   the   direction   of   Yudhishthira. \nYudhishthira      answered      with      barbed \narrows,   feathered   with   eagle-feathers.  But \nDrona  did  not  mind,  and  advanced  at  great  \nspeed.  Yudhishthira's  bow  was  cut  down \nand Drona was coming very near.  \nDhrishtadyumna   tried to   intercept   Drona \nbut   in   vain.   The   whole   army   shouted: \n\"Yudhishthira   has   been   taken!\"   So   near \ncame Drona. \nSuddenly,   then,   Arjuna   appeared   on   the \nbattlefield,   the   earth   rumbling   under   the \nwheels  of  his  chariot,  as  it  coursed  swiftly \nover   the   bloody   field, over   bones   and \nbodies   lying   in   heaps.   Drona   held   back, \nfor  Arjuna  had  come  on  the  scene.  From \nhis    Gandiva    bow    issued    a    continuous \nstream  of  arrows.  No  one  could  see  the \nshafts  taken  out  of  the  quiver  or  placed  in \n\nposition.  It  seemed  as  if,  from  out  of  the \ngreat   bow,   an   unending   flood   of   arrows \nissued        without        intermission.        The \nbattlefield      was      darkened      by      flying \nmissiles.  \nDrona    retreated.    Yudhishthira    was    not \ntaken.  The  battle  was  stopped  for  the  day \nand  the  Kaurava  forces  went  to  their  camp  \nin chastened mood.  \nThe   Pandava   army   marched   proudly   to \ncamp   and   behind   them   walked   Kesava \n(Krishna)    and    Arjuna    conversing.    Thus \nclosed the eleventh day of the battle. \n",

He  \nhas    promised    Duryodhana    to    take    me \nalive.   He   is   a   matchless   warrior,   brave, \nstrong   and   skilled   in,   every   branch   of \narchery.  He  knows  no  fatigue  and  nothing \nescapes his watchful eyes.\" \n\"King,  here  is  Satyajit,  standing  in  support  \nof  you,\"  replied  Arjuna.  \"As  long  as  he  is  \nalive  and  by  you,  nothing  can  happen  to \nyou.\"     So     saying     Arjuna     asked     the \nPanchala  prince  Satyajit  to  stand  guard  by \nYudhishthira's  side  and  marched  off  like  a  \nhungry lion to meet the samsaptakas.  \n\"There,      Krishna,      see      the      Trigartas \nstanding,    cheerful    under    the    intoxication \nof  their  oath,  though  they  know  they  go  to  \ncertain  death.  Indeed  they  are  full  of  the \nexultation    of    approaching    swarga.\"    So \nspeaking   to   his   great   charioteer,   Arjuna \napproached the large samsaptaka force.  \nThis   was   the   Twelfth   Day   of   the   great \nbattle.  It  was  a  fierce  fight.  After  a  time, \nArjuna's    attack    began    to    tell    and    the \nTrigartas   fell   in   swathes   before   him but \nSusarma    reminded    them    of    their    oath. \n\"Heroes,  we  have  taken  our  oaths  before \nthe  fire  and  in  the  presence  of  the  whole \narmy   of   warriors.   Having   sworn   terrible \nresolves,   it   is   unworthy   to   flinch.   Let   us \nnot     fall     into     public     ridicule.\"     The \nsamsaptakas    cheered    their    leader,    and \nfaced  Arjuna  with  the  sublime  courage  of \naccepted deaths.  \n\n\"Hrishikesa,   they   are   resolved   on   fighting \nto the last. Drive on,\" said Arjuna. \nDriven       by       Madhusudana       (Krishna) \nArjuna's  chariot  moved  like  Indra's  car  in \nthe   great   war   of   the   gods   against   the \nasuras.  It  went  here  and  it  went  there  and  \nwherever  it  went,  Arjuna's  great  bow,  the \nGandiva,     scattered     death     among     the \ndoomed Trigartas.  \nThe  burst  of  blood  in  their  compct  ranks \nwas  like  the  burst  of  Palasa  blossoms  in  a  \nspringtime      forest.     The     fighting     was \nsevere.   At   one   time   Arjuna's   car   and \nflagpole  were  immersed  in  darkness  under \nthe downpour of arrows.  \n\"Are    you    alive,    Dhananjaya?\"    shouted \nKrishna.  \n\"Yes,\"    replied    Arjuna,    and    pulling    the \nstring   of   his   Gandiva,   discharged   shafts \nthat   dispelled   the   arrow-shower.   It   was \nlike   the   Rudra   dance   of   dissolution.   The \nfield    was    full    of    severed    limbs    and \nheadless   bodies   and   presented   a   terrible \nspectacle. \nAs    Arjuna    proceeded    to    oppose    the \nsamsaptakas,   Drona   gave   orders   for   a \nviolent   assault   on the   Pandava   forces   at \nthe point where Yudhishthira stood.  \nYudhishthira     saw     this     movement     and \nspoke       to       the       Panchala       prince \nDhrishtadyumna: \n\"The   brahmana   is   coming   to   seize   me. \nLook after the forces with vigilance.\" \nThe   son   of   Drupada   did   not   wait   for \nDrona  to  advance  but  marched  forward  in \nhis      car      himself      to      meet      Drona. \nDronacharya      avoided      Dhrishtadyumna, \nfor   well   he   knew   that   his   death was \ndestined  to  be  at  his  hands  and  that  death \nwas   not   yet   due.   And   he   wheeled   his \nchariot      in      another      direction      where \nDrupada was leading his forces.  \nDrupada's        forces        suffered        heavy \npunishment   at   Drona's   hands   and   blood \nflowed    in    streams    on    the    battlefield. \nDrona,  then,  again  turned  his  attention  to \nYudhishthira.    The    Pandavas    stood    firm \nand     answered     Drona's     attacks     with \nshowers of arrows.  \nSatyajit  made  a  charge  on  Drona's  car  and  \nthere    was    a    fierce    combat    in    which \nDrona's   figure   assumed   the   grimness   of \nthe  Destroyer.  Many  a  warrior  was  slain \nby  him  in  succession.  Vrika,  a  prince  of \nPanchala, as well as Satyajit, fell dead.  \nSeeing    this,    Satanika,    son    of    Virata, \nmarched    against    Drona.    In    a    moment, \nSatanika's    severed    head    rolled    on    the \nground   with   the   golden   kundalas   shining \nin the earlobes.  \nKetama,  another  chief,  followed  the  attack  \nbut   he   too   perished.   Then,   Vasudhana \nrushed   forward   to   stop   the   advance   of \nDrona,  but  he  too  fell  dead.  Yudhamanyu,  \nSatyaki,   Sikhandin   and   Uttamaujas   who \ncame  to  push  Drona  back,  were  repulsed \nand  all  these  great  warriors  had  to  retreat.  \nDrona   was   now   almost   within   reach   of \nYudhishthira. \nAt   that   moment,   Panchalya,   another   son \nof  Drupada,  rushed  madly  up  to  stop  the \nacharya  and  fought  most  desperately.  But, \nhe   too   was   mortally   wounded   and   fell \nfrom his chariot like a failing star. \nThen,  Duryodhana  was  delighted  and  said \nexultingly to Karna: \n\"Radheya,   do   you   see   the   valor   of   our \nmighty  leader?  No  more  will  the  Pandavas  \nbe  inclined  towards  battle.  See  how  their \narmy reels under Drona's blows.\" \nKarna   shook   his   head.   \"Do   not   be   so \nconfident,\"  he  said.  \"The  Pandavas  are  not  \nto   be   so   easily   vanquished.   They    will \nnever   surrender.   The   wrongs   they   have \nundergone  are  too  great  to  be  forgotten. \nYou   tried   to   poison   and   kill   them.   You \ntried  to  burn  them  alive.  You  have  grieved  \nand  humiliated  them  at  the  game  of  dice \nand  you  have  forced  them  out  to  live  in \nthe   forest   for   long   years.   They   will   not \nsurrender.  See  there,  their  army  has  rallied  \nand  all  their  forces  are  leading  a  combined  \n\nattack    on    Drona.    There,    see    Bhima, \nSatyaki,      Yudhamanyu,      Kshatradharma, \nNakula,     Uttamaujas,     Drupada,     Virata, \nSikhandin.       Dhrishtaketu       and       other \nwarriors     have     all     come     to     protect \nYudhishthira  and  are  pressing  Drona  hard.  \nWe  should  not  stand  idly  watching,  when \nwe  have  put  such  a  heavy  burden  on  the \nacharya.  Great  as  he  is,  there  is  a  limit  to  \nthe  load  even  he  can  carry.  Even  wolves \ncombined in  large  numbers  can  harass  and  \nkill  a  mighty  elephant,  Let  us  proceed.  It \nwill   not   do   any   longer   to   leave   Drona \nunsupported.\"  \n",

      "content": "\nDRONA   made   many   attempts   to   take \nYudhishthira        prisoner,        but        failed. \nDuryodhana   led   a   large   elephant   division \nagainst    Bhima.    Bhima    defended    himself \nfrom his chariot with well-aimed arrows.  \nHe   sent   crescent-headed   shafts   and   tore \ndown  Duryodhana's  flag  and  cut  down  his  \nbow  even  as  he  held  it  in  his  hand.  Seeing  \nthe    king    harassed    in    this    manner,    the \nMlechchha    king    Anga    marched    against \nBhimasena seated on a huge elephant.  \nBut    Bhima    sent    shafts    that    laid    the \nelephant   low   and   killed   the   Mlechchha \nking,    which    resulted    in    scattering    that \nsection  of  the  Kaurava  forces  in  fear  and \nconfusion.         When         the         elephants \nstampeded,  the  horses  also  took  fright  and  \nthousands    of    footmen    were    trampled \nunder   the   feet   of   the   elephants   and   the \nhorses, flying in wild panic.  \nSeeing    this    great    confusion    and    the \nscattering   of   the   Kaurava   forces   in   all \ndirections,   the   king   of   Pragjyotisha,   the \nbrave Bhagadatta grew indignant.  \nHe    got    up    on    his    renowned    elephant \nSupratika  and  charged  against  Bhimasena. \nThe   gigantic   beast   rushed   forward   with \nwidespread     ears     and     twirling     trunk, \ncrashed   into   Bhimasena's   chariot.   And   in \nan   instant,   horses   and   vehicle   were   an \nunrecognizable   mass.   But   Bhima   escaped \nby jumping off the car in the nick of time.  \nHe   knew   all   about   elephants.   He   got \nbelow   the   great   and   fierce   elephant   and \nshowered   blows   on   its   vital   points.   The \ngreat   beast   got   mad   and   whirled   round \nlike   a potter's  wheel,  trying  to  throw  off \nBhimasena,   who   was   sticking   to   its   legs \nand attcking it from below.  \nIt   bent   down   and   caught   Bhima   by   its \ntrunk  and  was  about  to  crush  him  under  its  \nknees,  when  Vrikodara  somehow  released \nhimself  from  its  hold  and  again got  below,  \nin   between   its   limbs   and   sticking   to   the \nelephant's           under-regions,           caused \nexceeding pain to the beast. \nBhima  was  thus  gaining  time  in  the  hope \nthat   some   elephant   on   the   Pandava   side \nwould    be    led    to    attack    Bhagadatta's \nelephant and enable him to get away.  \nBut,  when  Bhima  disappeared  from  view, \nbeing  hidden  in  between  the  beast's  legs, \nthe    soldiers    thought    Bhima    was    slain. \nThey      exclaimed:      \"Bhima      is      dead! \nBhagadatta's       elephant       has       crushed \nBhimasena!\"  and  the  cry  was  repeated  all \nover Kurukshetra.  \nYudhishthira   heard   the   cry   and,   thinking \nBhima    was    slain,    urged    the    forces    to \ndestroy  Bhagadatta.  The  king  of  Dasarna \ncharged     against     Bhagadatta.     Dasarna's \nelephant  was  also  a  fierce  beast  and  there  \nwas   great   battle   between   Supratika   and \nDasarna's elephant.  \nBut    Supratika's    tusk    pierced    Dasarna's \nbeast  in  the  side  and  it  crashed  down  dead.  \nAt    that    moment,    Bhima    emerged    from \nbelow  Supratika  and  ran  out  safe.  And  the  \nPandava   army   cheered   when   they   saw \nBhima alive. \nBhagadatta  was  now  attacked  on  all  sides,  \nbut  he  did  not  lose  heart.  Resplendent  on \nhis  elephant,  he  shone  like  a  forest  fire  on \na   hill.   Ignoring   the   enemies   around   him, \nhe drove his beast on Satyaki's chariot.  \n\nThe   elephant   seized   the   chariot   with   its \ngreat   trunk   and   lifting   it   high   dashed   it \nupside   down.   Satyaki   jumped   out   of   the \nchariot in time to save himself.  \nHis   charioteer   displayed   great   agility   and \nskill  and  saved  the  vehicle  as  well  as  the \nhorses,  and  righting  the  chariot,  drove  it  to  \nwhere Satyaki stood.  \nBhagadatta's      elephant      wrought      great \nhavoc    in    the    Pandava    army,    hurling \nwarriors   about   and   killing   them   in   great \nnumber,   striking   terror   wherever   it   went. \nBhagadatta  stood  on  its  back,  like  Indra \non Airavata when he fought the asuras.  \nWith   ears   spread   out   rigid   in   anger   and \ntrunk   extended   in   front,   the   great   beast \ntrampled   upon   numerous   horses,   chariots \nand   soldiers   and   wrought   destruction   all \nover  the  Pandava  army.  The  shafts  hurled \nat it seemed only to incense it more.  \nLike  a  herdsman  in  the  forest  driving  the \ncattle   where   he   would,   Bhagadatta  drove \nthe   soldiers   of   the   Pandava   army   before \nhim.   Bhimasena,   equipping   himself   once \nagain   with   a   chariot,   renewed   his   attack \non Bhagadatta.  \nThe   elephant   stretched   out   its   trunk   and \nblew   out   a   violent   spray   of   mucus   that \nscared  the  horses  of  Bhima's  chariot  and \nthey     bolted     in     wild     flight     and     the \ncharioteer could not check them.  \nA  great  cloud  of  dust  rose  from  the  field \nwhere   this   great   elephant   battle   raged. \nArjuna    saw    this    from    where    he was \nfighting    the    samsaptakas    and    he    also \nheard   the   tumult   created  by  Bhagadatta's \nelephant.  \nHe  feared  things  had  gone  wrong  and  said  \nto  Krishna:  \"Madhusudana,  this  is  the  cry \nof   Supratika,   Bhagadatta's   elephant.   This \nking   of   Pragjyotisha   is   terrible   with   his \nelephant,  and  has  no  equal  in  that  kind  of \nwarfare.  He  is  sure  to  defeat  and  confound  \nour  men.  We  must  proceed  at  once  and \nsave    the    situation.    We    have    punished \nthese  samsaptakas  enough.  Drive  to  where  \nDrona   is   engaging   Yudhishthira.\"   Krishna \ndrove  the  chariot  accordingly  towards  the \nmain battlefront. \nSusarma  and  his  brothers  came  up  behind  \nthe   chariot   and   shouted   \"Stop,   stop.\"   At \nthe   same   time,   they   discharged   shafts   at \nArjuna's chariot.  \nArjuna was of two minds.  \n\"Here  is  Susarma  challenging  me  to  battle \nand    I    hated    declining    this    kind    of \ninvitation,  but  there,  to  the  north  of  us,  our  \nformation  seems  broken  and  our  men  are \nin need of immediate relief.\" \nWhile    Arjuna    was    pondering    thus,    a \njavelin     came     hurtling     at     Arjuna     and \nanother    towards    Janardana.    Wild    with \nanger,     Arjuna     sent     three     well-aimed \nshafts,   which   compelled   Susarma   to   turn \nback. \nThey  lost  no  more  time  but  drove  quickly \nto  where  Bhagadatta  was  doing  havoc.  As  \nsoon    as    Arjuna's    car    was    seen,    the \nPandava   forces   rallied   and   soon   Arjuna \nreached the lines where Bhagadatta was.  \nBhagadatta   attacked   Arjuna   on   Supratika \nlike      the      Destroyer      incarnate.      But \nVasudeva's   skill   avoided   the   shock,   each \ntime the beast charged.  \nBhagadatta   showered   arrows   on   Arjuna \nand   Krishna.   But   Arjuna's   arrows   broke \nthe  elephant's  armor  and  began  to  hurt  the  \nbeast.   Bhagadatta   saw   that   his elephant \ncould  no  longer  stand  the  attack  and  he \nhurled a javelin at Krishna.  \nArjuna  met  it  with  a  shaft  from  his  bow \nand   broke   it   into   two.   Bhagadatta   then \ndischarged    another    javelin    that    struck \nDhananjaya's helmet. \nReadjusting   his   helmet,   Arjuna   bent   his \nbow   exclaiming:   \"Bhagadatta,   take   your \nlast   look   at   the   world   and   prepare   for \ndeath!\"  \nBhagadatta     was     a     veteran     of     very \nadvanced    age.    His    grey    hair    and    the \nwrinkles   on   his   noble   old   face   gave   him \nthe  intrepid  appearance  of  a  lion.  Indeed, \n\nso   old   was   he   that   the   skin   hung   loose \ndown   over   his   eyes   and   he   had   tied   its \nfolds    over    his    forehead    with    a    silk \nkerchief   so   that   they   might   not   interfere \nwith his sight.  \nBhagadatta   was   not   more   renowned   for \nvalor   than   for   purity   of   character   and \nconduct    and    was    one    of    the    most \nillustrious   among   the   brave   men   of   his \ntime.   Men   gave   him   the   title   'Friend   of \nIndra' in recognition of his greatness. \n\"Look    around    for    the    last    time,\"    said \nArjuna  to  this  great  man  and  hurled  at  him  \nshafts   that   broke   his   bow,   shattered   his \nquiver and pierced the joints of his armor. \nIn   those   days,   all   warriors   wore   heavy \narmor    and    the    secret    of    hitting    weak \npoints  such  as  joints  and  moving  parts  was  \nspecially  studied  by  kshatriyas  and  was  an \nimportant part of military training.  \nWhen    deprived    of all    his    weapons, \nBhagadatta   hurled   his   elephant   goad   at \nArjuna.  It  was  sent  with  deadly  aim  and \ncharged with the Vaishnava mantra.  \nIt   would   have   killed   Arjuna,   but   Krishna \ncame  in  between  and  presented  himself  as  \na   target   for   the   missile.   It   settled   on   his \nchest as a shining necklace.  \nCharged   with   the   mantra   of   Vishnu,   it \ncould  not  hurt  Vishnu  but  just  became  the  \nLord's jewelled garland round his neck.  \n\"Janardana,   how   is   it   you   have   offered \nyourself    as    a    target    for    the    enemy's \nmissile?  You  said  you  would  be  charioteer  \nand   leave   all   the   fighting   to   me.   How \ncould you do this?\" protested Arjuna. \n\"Beloved  Arjuna,  you  do  not  understand. \nThis  shaft  would  have  killed  you  if  it  had \nhit  you.  But  it  is  really  my  own  thing  and  \ncame   back   to   its   lawful   owner,\"   Krishna \nsaid   and   laughed.   Then,   Partha   sent   an \narrow      that      entered      the      head      of \nBhagadatta's  elephant  as  a  serpent  enters \ninto the anthill.  \nBhagadatta   tried   to   urge   his   great   beast \nforward,  but  it  stood  stark  rigid.  And  his \nloud   command   went   in   vain   even   as   the \nwords  of  man,  who  has  lost  his  wealth,  are  \ndisregarded by his wife. \nLike   a   great   hill   the   elephant   stood   rigid \nfor   a   moment   and   then   it   suddenly   sank \ndown  driving  its  tusks  into  the  earth  and \nyielded   up   the   ghost   with   an   agonised \nsqueal. \nArjuna  was  somewhat  grieved  at  the  death  \nof  the  noble  animal  and  for  his  not  having \nbeen    able    to    slay    Bhagadatta,    without \nkilling the beast.  \nArjuna's  shafts  tore  the  silken  napkin  that \nbound   up   the   folds   of   the   aged   king's \nforehead  and  he  was  blinded  at  once  by \nhis own hanging wrinkles.  \nSoon,  a  sharp  crescent-headed  shaft  came  \nand  pierced  his  chest.  And  Bhagadatta  fell \nlike   a   great   tree   in   a   storm,   his   golden \nnecklace    shining    like    flowers    on    the \nuprooted  tree.  The  Kaurava  forces  fell  into  \nutter confusion. \nSakuni's  brothers  Vrisha  and  Achala  tried \ntheir  best  to  oppose  Arjuna  and  attacked \nhim   in   front   and   rear.   But   their   chariots \nwere  soon  dashed  to  pieces  and  they  were  \nthemselves  stricken  dead  on  the  field  like \ntwo   lion   cubs.   They   both   looked   much \nalike   and   equally   noble   in   appearance. \nThe  poet  says  that  the  bodies  of  these  two  \nvaliant  heroes  who  did  not  flee  when  the \nrest  fled,  shed  a  strange  lustre  all  around. \nSakuni  was  full  of  anger  when  he  saw  his  \nbrave    and    incomparable    brothers    lying \ndead on the field.  \nHe   attacked   Arjuna  fiercely  and  used  all \nthe  weapons  of  illusion,  in  which  he  was \nskilled.  But  Arjuna's  strokes  broke  all  the \ncharms   and   rendered   them   useless.   And \nSakuni  had  to  leave  the  field,  as  fast  as  his  \nhorses could bear him. \nThe  Pandava  forces  then  attacked  Drona's  \narmy   and   wrought   great   havoc   till   the \nsunset,  and  the  twelfth  day's  fight  ended. \nDrona   gave   orders   to   cease   fighting   and \nthe    Kaurava    forces,    which    had    lost \n\nheavily,  retired  in  sullen  dejection  to  their \ncamp.  \nThe  Pandava  army,  on  the  other  band,  was  \nin   high   spirits   and   its   warriors   gathered \nround    campfires    in    cheerful    talk    and \npraise  of  Arjuna  and  the  other  heroes,  who  \nhad led them to victory.  \n",

      "content": "\nEARLY   next   morning,   Duryodhana   went \nto  Dronacharya  in  a  state  of  bitterness  and  \nanger.   After   the   customary   salutation,   he \naddressed  him  thus  in  the  presence  of  a \nlarge number of generals: \n\"Esteemed    brahmana,    Yudhishthira    was \nquite   within   your   reach   yesterday   and,   if \nyou  had  really  wished  to  take  him  no  one  \ncould   have   prevented   you.   Yet,   you   did \nnot   take him,   and   to   me   the   events   of \nyesterday     are     inexplicable.     I     cannot \nunderstand  what  makes  it  hard  for  you  to  \ncarry  out  your  promise  to  me.  Verily  great  \nmen are not understandable.\"  \nDronacharya  was  exceedingly  hurt  by  this \ninsulting insinuation. \n\"Duryodhana,\"  he  said,  \"I  am  putting  forth \non  your  be  half  all  the  strength and  skill  I  \npossess.   You   entertain   thoughts   unworthy \nof  a  king.  As  long  as  Arjuna  is  present, \nsupporting   Yudhishthira,   it   is   not   possible \nfor  us  to  seize  him.  I  have  told  you  that \nalready.  It  is  only  if  we  manage  some  how  \nto  get  Arjuna  out  of  the  battlefield  that  we  \ncan   hope   to   carry   out   this   plan   as   you \ndesire.  And  I  am  devising  ways  to  attain \nthis objective.\" \nThus   did   Drona   nobly   conquer   his   just \nanger  and  seek  to  comfort  Duryodhana  in \nhis distress.  \nOn   the   thirteenth   day,   the   samsaptakas \nagain   challenged   Arjuna   to   battle   and   he \naccordingly   went   to   attack   them,   where \nthey  were  arrayed  to  the  south  of  the  main  \nbattlefront.    The    battle    that    was    fought \nbetween  the  samsaptakas  and  Arjuna  was \nthe   fiercest   that   ever   had   been   seen   or \nheard of till that day. \nWhen   Dhananjaya   left   the   main   front   for \nmeeting        the        samsaptakas,        Drona \nrearranged    his    army    in    lotus    formation \nand attacked Yudhishthira fiercely.  \nBhima,               Satyaki,               Chekitana, \nDhrishtadyumna,      Kuntibhoja,      Drupada, \nGhatotkacha,      Yudhamanyu,      Sikhandin, \nUttamaujas,       Virata,       the       Kekayas, \nSrinjayas   and   many   others   opposed   him. \nBut   their   resistance   seemed   paralysed   by \nthe violence of Drona's offensive.  \nAbhimanyu,  son  of  Arjuna  and  Subhadra, \nwas  still  adolescent,  but  had  already  won \nrecognition  as  a  mighty  man-at  arms  even \nas   the   equal   of   his   father   and   uncle   in \nbattle.     Yudhishthira     called     Abhimanyu \nand said to him: \n\"Dear   son,   Dronacharya   is   attacking   our \narmy  greatly.  Arjuna  is  absent  and,  if  we \nshould  be  defeated  in  his  absence,  he  will \nbe    grieved    beyond    measure.    No    one \namong  us  has  been  able  to  break  Drona's  \narray.  You  know  you  can  do  it  and  no  one  \nelse. I ask you to take up this task.\"  \n\"I  can  do  it,\"  replied  Abhimanyu.  \"I  have \nbeen    instructed    by    my    father    how   to \npenetrate   this   formation   and   can   certainly \ndo   so.   But   if   after   forcing   my   way,   it \nshould    unfortunately    become    necessary \nfor  me  to  come  out,  I  shall  be  at  a  loss \nwhat   to   do,   being   as   yet   uninstructed   in \nthe art of extrication.\" \n\"Valiant     boy,     break     this     impregnable \nformation  and  open  a  passage  for  us.  We  \nshall  all  break  in  your  wake.  We  shall  be  \nwith   you   to   face   any   danger   and   no \nquestion  can  arise  of  your  having  to  come  \nout.\" \nBhimasena        supported        Yudhishthira's \nproposal:   \"I   shall   be   immediately   behind \nyou    and    enter    when    you    succeed    in \nbreaking   the   enemy's   formation.   So   also \nwill       Dhrishtadyumna,       Satyaki,       the \nPanchalas,  the  Kekayas  and  the  forces  of \nMatsyadesa.  Only  break  the  formation  as \n\nyou  alone  can  do.  We  shall  do  the  rest  and  \nsmash the Kaurava army.\" \nAbhimanyu    thought    of    his    father    and \nKrishna.  Feeling  encouraged  by  what  had \nbeen        said        by        Bhimasena        and \nYudhishthira,   and   impelled   by   his   own \ngallant nature, undertook the adventure.  \n\"I  shall  please  my  great  father  and  uncle,\" \nhe  said  with  enthusiasm.  \"Let  my  valor  be  \nstaked on this.\"  \n\"May      your      prowess      grow,\"      said \nYudhishthira and blessed the youth. \n\"Sumitra,   see   Drona's   flag   flying   there! \nDrive  straight  and  fast  to  that  point,\"  said \nAbhimanyu to his charioteer. \n\"Faster,  faster!\"  urged  Abhimanyu  as  they \nsped along.  \n\"May   the   gods   protect   you!\"   said   the \ncharioteer.    \"Yudhishthira    has    placed    a \nvery     great     burden     on     your     young \nshoulders.   Think   well   before   you   pierce \nDrona's   array   and   enter.   The   acharya   is \nunrivalled   in   skill   and   experience,   while \nyou,   though   his equal   in   valor,   have   not \nhis long years to back it.\" \nAbhimanyu   smiled   and   replied:   \"Friend,   I \nam  Krishna's  nephew  and  son  of  Arjuna, \nam  I  not?  Which  other  has  that  advantage?  \nFear    dares    not    approach    me!    These \nenemies  here  have  not  a  sixteenth  part  of \nmy   strength.   Drive   fast   towards   Drona's \ndivision. Do not hesitate.\"  \nThe charioteer obeyed.  \nAs    the    golden    chariot    to    which    were \nyoked  beautiful  young  horses  approached, \nthe  soldiers  in  the  Kaurava  army  shouted: \n\"Abhimanyu   is   corning!   He   has   come!\" \nThe   Pandavas   followed   Abhimanyu   close \nbehind him.  \nThe  Kaurava  warriors  were  perturbed  as \nthey   saw   Abhimanyu's   chariot   approach \nthem with great speed.  \n\"Here  is  one  greater  in  valor  than  Arjuna,\" \nthey thought and began to lose heart.  \nLike  a  young  lion  on  a  herd  of  elephants, \nAbhimanyu  rushed  on.  There  was  a  ripple  \nin  the  Kaurava  ranks  which  bent  under  his  \nheadlong onslaught.  \nThe  bend  soon  became  a  break  and  under  \nDrona's    very    eyes,    the    formation    was \nbreached  and  Abhimanyu  entered.  But  the  \nbreach    closed    under    the    inspiration   of \nJayadratha,   king   of   the   Sindhus,   before \nthe   other   Pandava   warriors   could   force \ntheir    way    in    according    to    plan    and \nAbhimanyu was alone!  \nKaurava   warriors   opposed   him,   but   they \nfell    like    moths    in    the    fire,    one    after \nanother.   Abhimanyu's   shafts   searched   the \nweak  points  in  the  armor  of  his  enemies. \nAnd  the  bodies  of  soldiers  lay  strewn  on \nthe  field  like  Kusa  grass  on  the  sacrificial \nplatform. \nBows,   arrows,   swords,   shields,   javelins, \npieces   of   harness,   chaiot   canopies,   axes, \nmaces,   spears,   whips,   conchs,  along  with \nsevered  heads  and  limbs  of  slain  warriors,  \ncovered the field. \nSeeing      the      destruction      wrought      by \nAbhimanyu,   Duryodhana   was   wroth   and \nrushed   in   person   to   oppose   the   youthful \nwarrior.  Drona,  having  leant  that  the  king \nhimself     was     engaged     in     battle     with \nAbhimanyu,    became    anxious    and    sent \nveterans to protect Duryodhana.  \nWith    great    difficulty,    they    managed    to \nrescue   the   king   from   the   boy-hero   who \ngreatly    disappointed    at    the    escape    of \nDuryodhana,    vented    his    anger    on    the \nwarriors  that  had  come  to  rescue  him  and  \nput them to headlong flight. \nThen,   throwing   away   all   sense   of   shame \nand   chivalry,   a   large   number   of   veteran \nwarriors       made       a       combined       and \nsimultaneous    attack    on    the    hero,    who \nfound     himself     alone,     surrounded     by \nenemies  on  all  sides.  But,  even  as  on  all \nsides  a  rock  receives  the  rising  tide  of  the  \nsea,   Arjuna's   son   withstood   this   united \nouslaught.  \nDrona,      Aswatthama,      Kripa,      Karna, \nSakuni,    Salya    and    many    other    great \n\nwarriors   in   their   chariots,   equipped   with \nall   arms,   surged   in   attack   on   the   young \nhero,  only  to  be  dashed  back,  baffled  and  \nbroken.  \nAsmaka   rode   his   chariot   at   great   speed \nagainst       Abhimanyu's.       But       smiling, \nAbhimanyu   sent   his   shafts   and   disposed \nof   him   in   no   time.   Karna's   armor   was \npierced.  \nSalya  was  badly  wounded  and  sat,  unable  \nto   move,   in   his   chariot.   Salya's   brother \ncame   up   in   great   wrath   to   avenge   his \nbrother's    disgrace    but    he    fell    and    his \nchariot was broken to pieces. \nThus      did      Abhimanyu,      alone      and \nunsupported,   oppose   a   host   of   veteran \nwarriors  and  show  the  skill  in  the  use  of \narms    which    he    had    learnt    from    his \nillustrious   father   and   from   Vasudeva,   his \nuncle.     Seeing     this,     the     poet     says, \nDronacharya's   eyes   were   filled   with   tears \nof affectionate admiration.  \n\"Was  there  ever  a  fighter  to  equal  this  boy  \nAbhimanyu?\"   exclaimed   Drona   to   Kripa, \nin   the   hearing   of   Duryodhana   who   could \nnot contain his anger. \n\"The     acharya's     partiality     for     Arjuna \nprevents    him    from    killing    Abhimanyu,\" \nDuryodhana  said,  \"and  he  sings  his  praises  \ninstead    of    fighting    him.    Indeed,    if    the \nacharya    were    minded    to    dispose    of \nAbhimanyu,  would  it  take  him  long  to  do \nit!\"  \nOften     did     Duryodhana     suspect     and \ncomplain   in   this   manner   against   Bhishma \nand   Drona.   Having   undertaken   a   war   of \nadharma,  he  was  often  led  to  speak  in  this  \nmanner    and    hurt    the    feelings    of    the \nacharyas  who  stood  loyally  by  him,  even \nwhen   they   saw   the   wickedness   of   his \nways.  \nDuhsasana       roared       in       anger       and \nexclaiming:   \"This   obstinate   lad   will   perish \nnow!\"   led   his   chariot   forward   to   attack \nAbhimanyu.   The   chariots   of   Abhimanyu \nand        Duhsasana        made        wonderful \nmovement    against    each    other    and    the \nbattle raged long.  \nDuhsasana  was  struck  senseless  in  his  car,  \nand   his   charioteer   just   managed   to   drive \naway   from   the   field   saving   Duhsasana's \nlife.   Karna   attacked   Abhimanyu   with   his \nshafts and harassed him greatly.  \nBut    one    of    Abhimanyu's   arrows   felled \nKarna's    bow    and    the    young    warrior \nfollowed   up   this   advantage   so   vigorously \nthat  he  put  Karna  and  his  supporters  to \nflight.  The  Kaurava  forces,  when  they  saw \nthis, were completely demoralised. \nThe  army  was  in  confusion  and  men  fled \nin   all   directions,   not   caring   for   Drona's \nshouts   of   remonstrance.   And   Abhimanyu \ndestroyed  those  that  stood,  as  fire  destroys  \na dry jungle in summer. \n",

The  young \nhero  was  thus  isolated  and  surrounded  by \nthe Kaurava forces. \n\nThe    son    of    Subhadra    was    however \nundaunted.   He   attacked   all   the   warriors \naround    him    and    slew    them    in    great \nnumber.   Like   rivers   losing   themselves   in \nthe  ocean,  the  soldiers  that  went  to  attack  \nhim,   disappeared   before   his   arrows.   The \nKaurava   army   reeled   under   Abhimanyu's \nonslaughts.  \nDuryodhana's   son   Lakshmana,   a   gallant \nyoung       warrior,       then       charged       on \nAbhimanyu.      When      they      saw      this, \nretreating      soldiers      came      back      and \nsupported   Lakshmana,   showering   arrows \non Abhimanyu, like rain falling on a hill.  \nStill,  Arjuna's  son  was  undaunted  and,  his \nshaft    came    swift    and    shining,    like    a \nserpent      fresh-sloughed,      and      pierced \nLakshmana.    The    handsome    youth,   with \nbeautiful  nose  and  eyebrows  and  hair,  lay \ndead  on  the  field  and  the  Kaurava  soldiers  \nwere filled with grief. \n\"To    hell    with    the    wicked    Abhimanyu,\" \nshouted   Duryodhana,   and   the   six   great \nwarriors,        Dorna,        Kripa,        Karna, \nAswatthama,    Brihatbala    and    Kritavarma \nclosed upon Abhimanyu.  \n\"It   is   impossible   to   pierce   this   youth's \narmor,\"  said  Drona  to  Karna.  \"Aim  at  the  \nreins   of   his   horses   and   cut   them   off. \nDisable   him   thus   and   attack   him   from \nbehind.\" \nThe     son     of     Surya     did     accordingly. \nAbhimanyu's  bow  was  broken  by  a  shaft \ndischarged   from   behind.   His   horses   and \ncharioteer  were  killed.  Thus  disabled,  the \nyoung   warrior   stood   on   the   field,   with \nsword and shield, facing his enemies.  \nAs    he    stood    dauntless    like    kshatriya \ndharma   incarnate,   he   filled   the   warriors \naround     with     amazement.     Whirling     his \nsword,    he    held    his    own    against    the \nnumerous   warriors   who   had   surrounded \nhim, with a skill that confounded them.  \nIt  seemed  to  them  as  if  his  feet  did  not  rest  \non  earth  and  he  was  on  wings,  in  the  air.  \nDrona  sent  a  shaft  that  broke  Abhimanyu's  \nsword.    Karna's    sharp    arrows    tore    his \nshield into bits. \nThen   Abhimanyu   bent   down   and   taking \nup  one  of  his  chariot  wheels  and  whirling \nit   like   a   discus,   stood   up   facing   all   the \nenemies that surrounded him.  \nThe  dust  from  the  chariot  wheel  covered \nhim   and   the   poet   says   it   enhanced   the \nnatural    beauty of   the   young   hero.   He \nfought   fiercely   like   a   second Vishnu  with \nthe discus.  \nBut   soon,   the   combined   onslaught   of   the \nwarriors          that          surrounded          him \noverpowered  him.  The  chariot  wheel  was \nshattered  to  pieces.  The  son  of  Duhsasana  \ncame   up   then   and   closed   with   him   in \nmortal combat.  \nBoth  went  down  together  but  Duhsasana's  \nson  rose  again  and,  while  Abhimanyu  was  \nstruggling   to   his   feet,   struck   him   with   his \nmace and killed him. \n\"Subhadra's  son  who,  like  an  elephant  in  a  \nlily   pond,   single-handed  worked  havoc  in \nthe  Kaurava  army,  was  thus  overpowered \nby    numbers    and    killed    cruelly,\"    said \nSanjaya to Dhritarashtra.  \n\"And,    having    killed    him,    your    people \ndanced  around  his  dead  body  like  savage \nhunters  exulting  over  their  prey.  All  good \nmen  in  the  army  were  grieved  and  tears \nrolled  from  their  eyes.  Even  the  birds  of \nprey,  that  circled  overhead  making  noises \nseemed to cry 'Not thus!' 'Not thus!' \"  \nWhile   there   was   blowing   of   conchs   and \ncries  of  victory  all  over  the  Kaurava  army,  \nYuyutsu,  the  son  of  Dhritarashtra,  did  not \napprove   of   all   this.   \"This   is   ignoble,\"   he \nangrily cried. \n\"Soldiers,   you   have   forgotten   your   code. \nVerily,    you    should    be    ashamed    but, \ninstead,  you  shout  brazen  cries  of  victory. \nHaving   committed   a   most   wicked   deed, \nyou   revel   in   foolish   joy,   blind   to   the \ndanger that is imminent.\"  \nSo    saying,    Yuyutsu    threw    his    weapon \naway   in   disgust   and   left   the   battlefield. \n\nThis   young   son   of   Dhritarashtra   feared \nsin.   His   words   were   not   sweet   in   the \nKaurava  ears,  but  he  was  a  good  man  and  \nspoke out his mind.  \n",

O  warrior  \nthat  made  Duhsasana  flee  in  fear,  are  you \ndead?  What  then  is  there  for  me  to  fight \nfor   or   win?   Why   do   we   want   kingdom \nnow?

How  can  I  utter  to  them  vain \nwords   of   solace   that   serve   no   purpose? \nTruly,          ambition          destroys          the \nunderstanding  of  men.  Like  the  fool  who, \nlooking  for  honey,  falls  into  a  precipitous \npit  below  and  is  destroyed,  in  my  desire \nfor  victory  I  pushed  to  the  battlefront  this  \nboy,  whose  life  was  all  before  him  in  love  \nand  joy.  There  is  no  fool  like  me  in  the \nworld.  I  have  killed  Arjuna's  beloved  son,  \ninstead    of    protecting    him    during    the \nabsence of his father.\" \nThus     was     Yudhishthira     lamenting     in \nhistent.   Around   him   were  sitting  warriors, \nsilent  in  sorrowful  thought  of  the  valor  of \nthe   youthful   hero   and   his   cruel   death.   It \nwas   always   the   custom   with   Vyasa   to \ncome      and      comfort      the      Pandavas, \nwhenever they were in great sorrow.  \nHe   was   their   great   teacher   as   well   as \ngrandsire.   So   he   appeared   now   before \nYudhishthira.  The  sage  was  received  with \nall   honor   and   Yudhishthira,   having   made \nhim   sit,   said:   \"I   have   tried   very   hard   to \nfind   peace   of   mind,   but   I   am   unable   to \nfind it.\" \n\"You  are  wise  and  a  knower,\"  said  Vyasa,  \n\"and  it  is  not  meet  that  you  should  allow \nyourself  to  be  lost  in  grief  in  this  manner. \nKnowing  the  nature  of  death,  it  is  not  right  \nthat you should grieve like the unlearned.\"  \nVyasa  proceeded  to  console  the  bereaved  \nDharmaputra: \"When     Brahma     created \nliving   beings,   he was   filled   with   anxiety. \nThese   lives   will   multiply   and   soon   their \nnumber  will  be  beyond  the  capacity  of  the  \nearth  to  bear.  There  seems  to  be  no  way  of  \ncoping   with   this.   This   thought   of   Brahma \ngrew   into   a   flame   which   became   bigger \nand  bigger  until  it  threatened  to  destroy  all  \ncreation   at   once.   Then   Rudra   came   and \npleaded   for   allaying   this   destructive   fire. \nBrahma    controlled    the    great    fire    and \nsubdued  it  into  the  law  that  is  known  to \nmortals  as  Death.  This  law  of  the  creator \ntakes  many  forms,  such  as  war  or  sickness \nor  accident  and  keeps  the  balance  between  \nbirth     and     death.     Death     is     thus     an \ninescapable  law  of  existence,  ordained  for \nthe   good   of   the   world.   It   is   not   true \nwisdom  to  be  impatient  with  Death  or  to \ngrieve   immoderately   for   those   who   die. \nThere  is  no  reason  to  pity  those  who  pass  \naway.   We   may   have   reason   indeed   to \ngrieve    for    those    who    remain.\"    After \nsaying   these   words   of   solace,   Krishna \nDwaipayana retired. \nDhananjaya  and  Krishna  were  proceeding \ntowards   their   camp   after   defeating   and \nslaying the samsaptakas. \n\"Govinda,    I    do    not    know    why,\"    said \nArjuna,  \"but  my  mind  is  not  at  ease.  My \nmouth    feels    parched    and    my    heart    is \ntroubled  with  a  great  foreboding  of  loss.  I  \nwonder   if   any   calamity   has   happened   to \nYudhishthira.      Something      makes      me \nafraid, Krishna.\" \n\"Do        not       be       concerned       about \nYudhishthira,\"     replied     Krishna.\"He     and \nyour  other  brothers  are  safe.\"  On  the  way,  \nthey   halted   and   did   the   evening   prayers. \nRemounting  the  chariot,  they  proceeded  to  \nthe  camp.  As  they  approached  the  camp, \nArjuna's       premonitions       of       calamity \nincreased.  \n\n\"Janardana,   we   do   not   hear   the   usual \nauspicious     music     in     the     camp.     The \nsoldiers,  seeing  me  from  a  distance,  hang \ndown  their  heads  and  avoid  my  sight.  This  \nis    strange    behavior    on    their    part.    O \nMadhava,  I  fear  greatly.  Do  you  think  my \nbrothers  are  safe?  I  am  confused.  How  is  \nit  Abhimanyu  does  not  run  out  to  meet  us  \ntoday    as    usual,    accompanied    by    his \nbrothers?\" \nThey entered the camp.  \n\"Why  are  you  all  wearing  sad  faces?  I  do  \nnot  see  Abhimanyu  here.  How  is  it  I  see \nno   glad   faces?   I   understood that   Drona \narrayed   his   army   in   the   lotus   formation. \nNo  one  among  you  could  pierce  it  as  far  \nas  I  know.  Did  Abhimanyu  force  his  way \nin?  If  so,  he  is  dead,  for  I  did  not  teach \nhim   how   to   make   his   way   out   of   that \nformation. Has he been slain indeed?\" \nWhen      their      mournful      silence,      and \ndowncast   eyes,   that   dared   not   meet   his, \nhad     confirmed     his     worst     fears,     the \nbereaved   father   burst   into   heart-broken \nlamentation. \n\"Alas,   has   my   dear   boy   indeed   become \nYama's    guest?    Yudhishthira,    Bhimasena, \nDhrishtadyumna   and   great   Satyaki   have \nall  of  you  allowed  the  son  of  Subhadra  to  \nbe    slain    by    the    enemy?    Alas!    What \ncomfort   shall   I   give   to   Subhadra?   What \nshall.  I  say  to  Draupadi?  And  what  solace  \ncan  be  given  to  Uttara  and  who  shall  give  \nit?\" \nVasudeva   spoke   to   his   stricken   friend. \n\"Beloved   Arjuna,\"   he   said,   \"do   not   give \nway  thus  to  grief.  Born  as  kshatriyas  we \nhave  to  live  and  die  by  weapons.  Death  is  \never   the   companion   of   those   who   have \ntaken   up   the   profession   of   arms   and   go \ninto    battle,    determined    not    to    retreat. \nWarriors  must  be  ever  ready  to  die  young.  \nAbhimanyu,  boy  as  he  was,  has  attained \nthe    happy    regions    above    which    grey \nhaired   veterans   yearn to   reach   in   battle. \nAbhimanyu's  end  is  indeed  the  prescribed \nand  much  desired  goal  of  all  kshatriyas.  If \nyou   give   way   to   grief   in   this   inordinate \nway,   your   brothers   and   other   kings   will \nlose    heart.    Stop    grieving    and    infuse \ncourage  and  fortitude  into  the  hearts  of  the  \nothers,\" \nDhananjaya   desired   to   be   told   the   full \nstory     of     his     brave     son's     end     and \nYudhishthira      related      it:      \"I      incited \nAbhimanyu to      enter      the      enemy's \nformation.  For  I  knew  that  he  alone  could  \ndo  it  among  all  of  us.  'Make  your  way  into  \nthe    lotus    array    and    we    shall    follow \nimmediately   behind   you.   This   great   deed \nof   yours   will   please   the   hearts   of   your \nfather  and  your  uncle,'  I  said.  The  youthful  \nhero  did  accordingly  and  broke  the  great \nformation  and  made  his  way  in.  We  went  \nbehind   him   according   to   plan.   But,   just \nthen,   the   wicked   Jayadratha   came   and \neffectively    stopped    us.    He    caused    the \nbreach  in  the  formation  to  be  closed  up  at  \nonce   and   we   found   ourselves   unable   to \nfollow   Abhimanyu.   The   Sindhu   kept   us \nout,   and   then,   Oh,   shame   on   kshatriyas \nwho     could     do     this!     A     crowd     of \nredoubtable  warriors  hemmed  him  in,  thus \nisolated, and slew him.\" \nWhen  he  heard  the  full  story,  Arjuna  was  \nagain   over   whelmed   by   grief   and   he   fell \non the ground in a swoon. \nWhen   he   recovered,   he   took   an   oath: \n\"Before  sunset  tomorrow,  I  shall  slay  this \nJayadratha  who  caused  my  son's  death.  If \nDrona  and  Kripa  come  between  him  and \nme     these     acharyas     also     shall     be \noverwhelmed and slain!\"  \nSaying    this,    he    twanged    the    Gandiva \nstring,  and  Krishna  blew  the  Panchajanya. \nAnd Bhima said:  \n\"This   twang   of   Arjuna's   bow   and   this \nblare  of  Krishna's  conch  shall  be,  unto  the  \nsons   of   Dhritarashtra,   the   summons   of \nDeath!\" \n",

The   spies   informed   Duryodhana's \nfriends    that    Arjuna,    having    learnt    that \nJayadratha  was  the  cause  of  Abhimanyu's \ndeath,  had  vowed  to  kill  the  Sindhu  king \nbefore sunset next day.  \nVriddhakshatra,   the   illustrious   king   of  the \nSindhus,  was  blessed  with  a  son,  who  was  \nnamed  Jayadratha.  At  the  time  of  the  birth \nof  the  prince,  a  voice  was  heard  to  say: \n\"This  prince  will  attain  great  glory  and  he \nwill   attain   the   happy   regions   above,   slain \nin  battle.  One  who,  among  the  warriors  of \nall  ages,  ranks  among  the  most  illustrious \nwill,  in  the  field  of  battle,  sever  his  head \nfrom the body.\" \nAll  living  beings  must  die  but  hardly  any, \nhowever    wise    or    brave,    welcome    it. \nVriddhakshatra   was   grieved   to   hear   the \nvoice declare his son's end.  \nIn  his  disturbed  state  of  mind,  he  uttered  a  \ncurse:  \"He,  who  shall  cause  my  son's  head  \nto  roll  down  on  the  ground,  shall  have  his  \nhead    burst    at    that    very    moment    into \nfragments.\" \nJayadratha  grew  up  and,  when  he  reached  \nmanhood,  Vriddhakshatra  handed  over  the  \ncare  of  the  State  to  the  prince.  He  retired  \nto  the  forest,  where  he  spent  the  evening \nof   his   days   in   austerities   in   an   ashrama \nnear   the   plain,   which   afterwards   became \nthe Kurukshetra field of battle.  \nWhen   Jayadratha   came   to   know   about \nArjuna's      vow,      he      remembered     the \nprediction  about  his  death  and  feared  his \nend was near.  \n\"I   do   not   want   to   be   in   this   battle   any \nlonger.  Let  me  go  back  to  my  country,\"  he  \nsaid to Duryodhana. \n\"Do      not      fear,      Saindhava,\"      replied \nDuryodhana.   \"Here   are   all   these   veterans \nand  warriors  who  will  stand  between  you \nand  danger.  Karna,  Chitrasena,  Vivimsati, \nBhurisravas,            Salya,            Vrishasena, \nPurumitra,       Jaya,       Bhoja,       Kamboja, \nSudakshina,          Satyavrata,          Vikarna, \nDurmukha,   Duhsasana,   Subahu,   Kalinga, \nthe     Avanti     princes,     Drona,     Drona's \nillustrious     son     and     Sakuni     all     these \nwarriors   and   I   myself   are   here   and   you \ncannot   be   in   danger.   The   whole   of   my \narmy   will   have   but   one   task   today,   to \ndefend   you   against   Arjuna.   You   should \nnot   leave   us   now.\"   Jayadratha   agreed   to \nremain. He went to Drona and said to him: \n\"Master,   you   taught   me   and   Arjuna   and \nyou   know   us   both   well.   What   is   your \nappraisal of us two?\" \n\"Son,   I   discharged   my   duties   as   teacher \nand   dealt   with   you   both   impartially.   The \ninstruction   was   the   same   to   you   and   to \nArjuna,  but  Arjuna  excels  because  of  his \nsuperior   discipline   and   his   own   practice. \nBut,  you  need  not  be  discouraged  by  this.  \nYou  will  be  placed  behind  a  strong  force \nthat   Arjuna   cannot   easily   pierce.   Fight \naccording     to     the     tradition     of     your \nancestors.  Death  comes  to  us  all,  cowards  \nas   well   as brave   men.   And   the   warrior \ndying  in  battle  attains  with  ease  the  happy \nregions    which    others    only    attain    with \ngreat difficulty. Discard fear and fight.\"  \nDrona,  having  spoken  thus  to  Jayadratha, \nproceeded   to   marshal   the   forces   for   the \nnext  day.  Twelve  miles  to  the  rear  of  the  \nmain  army  Jayadratha  and  his  detachment \nwere     placed     in     a     strongly     guarded \nposition.  \nBhurisravas,    Karna,    Aswatthama,    Salya, \nVrishasena  and  Kripa  were  there  with  all \ntheir    forces.    Between    them    and    the \nPandava   army,   Dronacharya   arrayed   the \nmain       Kaurava       forces       in       circular \nformation.  \nDurmarshana's    army    was    beaten.    Like \nclouds    driven    about    by    a    gale,    the \nKaurava  forces  were  scattered  and  fled  in \nall   directions.   When   Duhsasana   saw   this, \nhis anger rose.  \nLeading   a   huge   force   of   elephants   he \nsurrounded  Arjuna.  Duhsasana  was  a  very \nwicked   man   but   he   was   brave   also.   He \n\nfought   Arjuna   fiercely   and   the   field   was \nstrewn     with     the     dead.     Finally,     he \nwithdrew  defeated  and  went  back  to  join \nDrona's forces. \nSavyasachi's      car      swiftly      proceeded \nforward    and    passed    Drona.    \"Illustrious \none,  grieving  for  my  son,  I  have  come  to  \nwreak   vengeance   on   the   Sindhu   king.   I \ncrave   your   blessings   for   the   fulfilment   of \nmy vow,\" said Arjuna to the acharya.  \nThe  acharya  smiled  and  said:  \"Arjuna,  you \nmust  first  fight  and  defeat  me  before  you \ncan   reach   Jayadratha.\"   Saying   this   Drona \ndischarged  a  shower  of  arrows  on  Arjuna's  \ncar.   Partha   also   replied   with   his   arrows \nbut   these   the   acharya   parried   with   ease \nand   sent   flaming   shafts   that   hit   Krishna \nand Arjuna.  \nThe  Pandava  then  decided  to  cut  Drona's  \nbow    and    bent    his    Gandiva    for    that \npurpose.    Even    as    he    was    pulling    his \nbowstring  Drona's  shaft  came  and  cut  the \nstring.  \nThe   acharya,   still   retaining   the   smile   on \nhis   face,   rained   a   shower   of   arrows   on \nArjuna  and  his  horses  and  chariot.  Arjuna \nfought  back,  but  the  acharya  showered  his  \narrows  that  covered  Arjuna  and  his  chariot  \nin darkness. \nKrishna  saw  things  were  not  going  at  all \nwell  and  said:  \"Partha,  no  more  waste  of \ntime.  Let  us  proceed.  It  is  no  use  fighting \nthis   brahmana,   who   seems   to   know   no \nfatigue.\"     Saying     this,     Krishna     drove \nArjuna's  chariot  to  the  left  of  the  acharya \nand proceeded forward. \n\"Stop,  surely  you  will  not  proceed  without  \ndefeating your enemy,\" said Drona. \n\"You   are   my   guru,   not   my   enemy,   O \nacharya.  I  am  in  the  position  of  a son  to  \nyou.  There  is  no  one  in  the  wide  world \nthat  can  defeat  you,\"  said  Arjuna  and  they \nproceeded    forward    at    a    swift    pace \nbypassing Drona. \nThen    Arjuna    pierced    the    Bhoja    army. \nKritavarma  and  Sudakshina  who  opposed \nhis    passage    were    defeated.    Srutayudha \nalso  tried  to  stop  Arjuna's  progress.  There  \nwas   a   fierce   battle   in   which   Srutayudha \nlost  his  horses  and  he  hurled  his  mace  at \nKrishna. \nHis  mother  had  obtained  this  mace  as  a \nresult   of   her   offering   but   the   condition \nattached  to  the  boon  operated  and  it  came  \nback  and  struck  Srutayudha  himself  dead. \nThis is the story of the mace. \nParnasa     went     through     penances     that \npleased   Varuna   and   obtained   from   that \ngod  a  boon  that  her  son  Srutayudha  may \nnot be killed by any enemy. \n\"I   shall   give   your   son   a   divine   weapon. \nLet  him  use  it  in  all  his  battles.  No  enemy \nwill  be  able  to  defeat  him  or  kill  him.  But  \nhe  should  not  use  the  weapon  against  one  \nwho  does  not  fight.  If  he  does,  the  weapon  \nwill   recoil   and   kill   him.   Saying   this,   god \nVaruna   gave   a   mace.   Srutayudha,   when \nfighting        Arjuna,        disregarding        the \ninjunction,    hurled    the    mace    at    Krishna \nwho  was  not  fighting  but  was  only  driving \nArjuna's chariot.  \nThe    missile    hit    Janardana's    chest    and \nimmediately    rebounded fiercely   back   to \nSrutayudha.   And   like   a   demon   recoiling \nfatally   on   the   magician,   that   commits   an \nerror   in   uttering   the spell   of   power   that \nholds   it   in   thrall,   it   slew   Srutayudha   and \nlaid   him   dead   on   the   field,   like   a   great \nforest tree blown down by a storm. \nThen  the  king  of  Kamboja  led  his  forces \nagainst  Arjuna.  After  a  fierce fight,  he  lay \nstretched   dead   on   the   field   like   a   great \nflagstaff after the festival is over. \nWhen    they    saw    the    strong    warriors, \nSrutayudha    and    the    king    of    Kamboja, \nslain,   the   Kaurava   force   was   in   great \nconfusion.  \nSrutayu   and   his   brother   Asrutayu   then \nattacked   Partha   on   both   sides   trying   to \nsave   the   situation,   and   greatly   harassed \nhim.   At   one   stage   of   this   battle,   Arjuna \n\nleaned   on   the   flagstaff,   dazed   with   the \nwounds he received.  \nBut   Krishna   spoke   to   him   encouragingly \nand   Arjuna   recovered   and   resumed   the \nfight,  slaying  the  two  brothers  as  well  as \ntheir  two  sons  who  continued  the  struggle.  \nArjuna    marched    on    and,    killing    many \nmore   warriors   successfully   made   his   way \nto Jayadratha. \n",

      "content": "\nWHEN  Dhritarashtra  heard  Sanjaya  relate \nthe  success  of  Arjuna,  he  exclaimed:  \"Oh \nSanjaya!     When     Janardana     came     to \nHastinapura   seeking   a   settlement,   I   told \nDuryodhana      that      it      was      a      great \nopportunity  and  he  must  not  lose  it.  I  told  \nhim    to    make    peace    with    his    cousins. \n'Kesava  has  come  to  do  us  a  good  turn.  Do  \nnot    disregard    his    advice,'    I    said.    But \nDuryodhana  heeded  not.  What  Karna  and  \nDuhsasana    said    seemed    to    him    better \nadvice   than   mine.   The   Destroyer   entered \nhis   mind   and   he   sought   his   own   ruin. \nDrona    deprecated    war,    so    also    did \nBhishma,   Bhurisravas,   Kripa   and   others. \nBut   my   obstinate   son   would   not   listen. \nImpelled   by   inordinate   ambition,   he   got \nentangled  in  anger  and  hatred,  and  invited \nthis ruinous war.\" \nTo   Dhritarashtra   thus   lamenting,   Sanjaya \nsaid:  \"Of  what  avail  are  your  regrets  now?  \nThe   life-giving  water  has  all  run  to  waste  \nand  you  now  seek  to  stop  the  breach.  Why  \ndid  you  not  prevent  the  son  of  Kunti  from \ngambling?   Had   you   done   the   right   thing \nthen,  all  this  great  grief  would  have  been \nstopped  at  the  source.  Even  later,  if  you \nhad  been  firm  and  stopped  your  son  from \nhis   evil   ways,   this   calamity   could   have \nbeen  avoided.  You  saw  the  evil  and  yet, \nagainst   your   own   sound   judgment,   you \nfollowed  the  foolish  advice  of  Karna  and \nSakuni.   Kesava,   Yudhishthira   and   Drona \ndo  not  respect  you  now  as  they  did  before.  \nVasudeva   now   knows  that  your  rectitude \nis  only  hypocrisy.  The  Kauravas  are  now \ndoing   their   utmost   as   warriors,   but   they \nare   unequal   to   opposing   the   strength   of \nArjuna,    Krishna,    Satyaki    and    Bhima. \nDuryodhana  has  not  spared  himself.  He  is  \nputting  forth  his  utmost  strength.  It  is  not \nmeet  that  you  should  now  accuse  him  or \nhis devoted soldiers.\" \n\"Dear   Sanjaya,   I   admit   my   dereliction   of \nduty.  What  you  say  is  right.  No  one  can \nchange   the   course   of   fate.   Tell   me   what \nhappened.   Tell   me   all,   be   it   ever   so \nunpleasant,\"   said   the   old   king   convulsed \nwith  grief.  And  obedient  to  the  old  king's \nbehest, Sanjaya continued his narration.  \nDuryodhana  was  greatly  agitated  when  he \nsaw        Arjuna's        chariot        proceeding \ntriumphantly  towards  the  Sindhu  king.  He \nrushed to Drona and complained bitterly: \n\"Arjuna  has  effected  a  breach  in  the  great  \narmy   and   has   advanced   to   Jayadratha's \nposition.    Seeing    our    discomfiture,    the \nwarriors,   protecting   the   Sindhu   king,   will \nsurely  lose  heart.  They  had  believed  that  it  \nwas  impossible  for  Arjuna  to  get  past  you \nand    that    has    now    been    falsified.    He \nadvanced   before   your   eyes   and   nothing \nwas  done  to  prevent  it.  You  seem  indeed  \nbent   on   helping   the   Pandavas.   I   am   in \ngreat  distress  of  mind.  Sir,  tell  me,  in  what  \nmatter  have  I  offended  you?  Why  are  you \nletting   me   down   in   this   way?   If   I   had \nknown   that   you   would   do   this,   I   should \nnot  have  asked  Jayadratha  to  stay  here.  It  \nwas   a   great   mistake   I   committed   in   not \nletting  him  go,  as  he  desired,  back  to  his \nown  country.  If  Arjuna  attacks  him,  it  is \nnot   possible   for   him   to   escape   death. \nForgive     me.     I     am     talking     foolishly, \ndistracted    by    grief.    Do    go    in    person \nyourself to save the Saindhava.\"  \nTo  this  frantic  appeal  Drona  made  answer: \n\"King,   I   shall   not   take   offence   at   your \nthoughtless   and   unworthy   remarks.   You \nare  like  a  son  to  me.  Aswatthama  himself \nis  not  dearer!  Do  what  I  ask  you.  Take  this  \ncoat  of  armor  and,  donning  it,  go  and  stop  \n\nArjuna.  I  cannot  do  so  for  my  presence  is  \nnecessary   in   this   part   of   the   field.   See \nthere,  the  clouds  of  arrows!  The  Pandava \narmy    is    attacking    us    in    great    force. \nYudhishthira     is     here     unsupported     by \nArjuna  and  is  this  not  just  the  opportunity \nwe  wanted?  Our  very  plan  has  borne  fruit  \nand     I     must     now     take     Yudhishthira \nprisoner  and  deliver  him  to  you.  I  cannot \ngive    up    this    objective    and    run    after \nPhalguna  now.  If  I  go  after  Arjuna  now, \nour  battle  array  will  be  hopelessly  broken \nand  we  shall  be  lost.  Let  me  put  this  armor  \non   you.   Go   in   confidence.   Do   not   fear. \nYou  have  valor,  skill  and  experience.  This  \ncoat  will  protect  you  against  all  weapons. \nIt  will  not  let  any  blow  pass  through  your  \nbody.  Go  forth  to  battle,  Duryodhana,  in \nconfidence  as  Indra  did,  clad  in  the  armor  \ngiven  by  Brahma.  May  victory  be  yours.\" \nDuryodhana's    confidence    was    restored \nand,   as   the   acharya   directed,   he   went, \ndressed  in  magic  armor  and  accompanied \nby   a   large   force   of   soldiers,   to   attack \nArjuna.  \nArjuna  had  crossed  the  Kaurava  army  and  \ngone  far  ahead  towards  where  Jayadratha \nhad  been  kept  for  safety.  Seeing  that  the \nhorses   were   somewhat   fatigued,   Krishna \nstopped   the   chariot   and   was   about   to \nunyoke    the    tired    animals,    when    the \nbrothers   Vinda   and   Anuvinda   came   up \nsuddenly and began to attack Arjuna.  \nThey  were  defeated  and  Arjuna  scattered \ntheir   forces   and   slew   them   both.   After \nthis,  Krishna  unyoked  the  chariot  and  let \nthe   horses   roll   in   the   mud.   The   horses \nrested   for   a   while   and   were   refreshed. \nThen,   they   proceeded   again   according   to \nplan. \n\"Dhananjaya,   look   behind!   There   comes \nthe    foolhardy    Duryodhana.    What    good \nluck!    Long    have    you    suppressed    your \nanger,  and  now  is  the  time  for  you  to  let  \nyourself  go.  Here  is  the  man  who  caused \nall   this   grief,   delivering   himself   into   your \nhands.  But  remember  he  is  a  great  archer,  \nwell-versed  in  bow  lore,  and  also  a  keen \nand     strong-limbed     fighter.\"     Thus     said \nKrishna  and  they  halted  to  give  battle  to \nthe Kaurava. \nDuryodhana approached without fear.  \n\"They   say,   Arjuna,   that   you   have   done \nacts   of   prowess.   I   have   not   seen   this \nmyself.   Let   me   see   if   your   courage   and \nyour   skill   are   indeed   as   great   as   your \nreputation,\"  said  Duryodhana  to  Arjuna  as \nhe began to battle. \nThe     combat    was    fierce    indeed    and \nKrishna was surprised.  \n\"Partha,   I   am   astonished,\"   said   Krishna, \n\"How  is  it  your  arrows  do  not  seem  to \nhurt   Duryodhana?   This   is   the   first   time   I \nsee     the     shafts     proceeding     from     the \nGandiva   bow   strike   their   targets   without \neffect.   This   is   strange,   Have   your   arms \nlost  their  power?  Or  has  the  Gandiva  bow  \nlost  its  quality?  Why  do  your  arrows  strike  \nDuryodhana    and    drop    to    the    ground \nwithout     piercing     him?     This     is     most \npuzzling.\"  \nArjuna   smiled   and   replied:   \"I   understand. \nThis  man  has  come  dressed  by  Drona  in \ncharmed   armor.

Now    standing    on    the \nshafts   of   the   vehicle,   now   on   the   horses \nand  now  on  the  yoke,  he  attacked  Drona  \nbewilderingly,    all    the    while    seeming    to \nscorch   him   with   baleful   and   bloodshot \neyes.  \nLong   did   this   fight   go   on.   Drona   pulled \nhis  bow  in  great  wrath  and  sent  a  shaft, \nwhich   would   have   drunk   the   Panchala's \nlife  but  for  the  unexpected  intervention  of \nSatyaki   who   sent   an   arrow   and   diverted \nthe acharya's shaft.  \nDrona   then   turned   and   attacked   Satyaki, \nwhich   enabled   the   Panchala   warriors   to \ntake      Dhrishtadyumna      away.      Drona, \nhissing   like   a   black   cobra,   his   eyes   red \nwith  anger,  advanced  on  Satyaki  who  was  \namong   the   front   rank   warriors   on   the \nPandava   side   and   who,   when   he   saw \nDrona   desiring   battle,   went   forward   to \naccept the challenge.  \n\"Here    is the   man   who,   giving   up   his \nvocation  as  a  brahmana  has  taken  up  the \nprofession    of    fighting    and    is    causing \ndistress  to  the  Pandavas,\"  Satyaki  said  to \nhis   charioteer.   \"This   man   is   the   principal \ncause    of    Duryodhana's    arrogance. This \nman   fancies   himself   a   very great   soldier \nand  is  ever  bursting  with  conceit.  I  must \nteach   him   a   lesson.   Take   the   chariot   up \nquickly.\" \nSatyaki's  charioteer  accordingly  lashed  the \nsilver-white  horses  and  took  the  car  at  a \ngreat  pace.  Satyaki  and  Drona  shot  shafts  \nat  one  another  so  quick  that  they  covered  \nthe    sun,    and    the    battlefield    was    in \ndarkness   for   a   while.   The   steel   shafts \nswished    glimmering    like    newly-sloughed \nsnakes rushing about. \nThe   chariot   hoods   and   the   flagstaffs   on \nboth  sides  were  battered  down.  Drona  as  \nwell   as   Satyaki   were   bleeding   profusely. \nThe   warriors   on   either   side   stood   still \nwatching  the  duel  and  they  did  not  blow \ntheir   conchs   or   raise   their   war   cries   or \nsound their lion-roars.  \nThe  Devas,  Vidyadharas,  Gandharvas  and \nYakshas   watched   the   great   battle   from \nabove.  Drona's  bow  was  broken  by  a  well-\naimed  shaft  from  Satyaki,  and  the  son  of \nBharadwaja  had  to  take  another  bow  and,  \neven  as  he  strung  it,  Satyaki  shot  it  down \nagain.  Drona  took  up  another  bow    that \ntoo was shot down.  \nAnd   so   it   went   on   till   Drona   lost   a \nhundred  and  one  bows  without  being  able  \nto  shoot  an  arrow.  The  great  acharya  said  \nto  himself:  \"This  man  Satyaki  is  a  warrior \nin    the    class    of    Sri    Rama,    Kartavirya, \nDhananjaya   and   Bhishma,\"and   was   glad \nhe had an opponent worthy of him.  \nIt   was   a   craftsman's   professional   joy   at \nskill   displayed   in   the   art   he   loved.   For \nevery   specially-charged   shaft   that   Drona \nsent,    Satyaki    had    a    ready    answer    of \nequivalent    quality.    Long    did    this    equal \ncombat  continue.  Drona  of  unrivalled  skill \nin  archery  then  resolved  on  killing  Satyaki \nand   sent   the   fire   astra.   But   Satyaki   saw \nthis  and,  losing  no  time,  sent  the  Varuna \nastra to counteract it. \n\nBut   now   Satyaki's   strength   began   to   fail \nand,   seeing   this,   the   Kaurava   warriors \nwere    glad    and    shouted    in    satisfaction. \nWhen  Yudhishthira  saw  Satyaki was  hard  \npressed,   he   told   those   nearby   to   go   to \nSatyaki's  relief.  \"Our  great  and  good  hero  \nYuyudhana         (Satyaki)         is         being \noverpowered   by   Drona.   You   should   go \nthere at once,\" he said to Dhrishtadyumna.  \n\"The      brahmana      will      otherwise      slay \nSatyaki   in   a   few   minutes.   Why   are   you \nhesitating?   Go   at   once.   Drona   is   playing \nwith  Satyaki  as  a  cat  plays  with  a  bird. \nSatyaki   is   indeed   in   the   paws   of   the \nDestroyer.\"     Yudhishthira     ordered     the \narmy  to  make  a  powerful  attack  on  Drona.  \nSatyaki    was    saved    with    difficulty.    Just \nthen,   the   sound   of   Krishna's   conch   was \nheard  from  the  sector  where  Arjuna  was \nfighting. \n\"O   Satyaki,   I   hear   Panchajanya,\"   cried \nYudhishthira;   \"but   the   twang   of   Arjuna's \nbow  does  not  accompany  it.  I  fear  Arjuna  \nhas    been    surrounded    by    Jayadratha's \nfriends    and    is    in    danger.    Arjuna    is \nopposed   by   forces   both   in   front   of   him \nand   in his  rear.  He  pierced  the  Kaurava \nranks  in  the  morning  and  he  has  not  come  \nback  yet  though  the  greater  part  of  the  day  \nis   gone.   How   is   it   that   only   Krishna's \nconch   is   heard?   I   fear   Dhananjaya   has \nbeen  slain  and  therefore  Krishna  has  taken \nup   arms.   Satyaki,   there   is   nothing   you \ncannot    accomplish.    Your    bosom    friend \nArjuna,   he,   who   taught   you,   is   in   mortal \ndanger.   Often   has   Arjuna   spoken   to   me \nadmiringly     of     your     great     skill     and \nprowess.  'There  is  not  another  soldier  like  \nSatyaki,'  he  said  to  me  when  we  were  in \nthe   forest.   Oh,   look   there!   The   dust   is \nrising   that   side.   I   am   certain   Arjuna   has \nbeen  surrounded.  Jayadratha  is  a  powerful \nwarrior,    and    there    are    many    enemy \nwarriors  there  helping  him  and  resolved  to  \ndie    in    defence    of    him.    Go    at    once, \nSatyaki.\"  Thus  did  Dharmaputra  speak  in \ngreat trepidation. \nSatyaki,   who   was   weary   after   his   battle \nwith    Drona,    replied:    \"Faultless    among \nmen,   I   shall   obey   your   command.   What \nwould  I  not  do  for  Dhananjaya's  sake? My \nlife  is  the  merest  trifle  in  my  eyes.  If  you \norder   me,   I   am   ready   to   fight   the   gods \nthemselves.   But   allow   me   to   put   before \nyou  what  the  wise  Vasudeva  and  Arjuna \ntold   me   when   they   left.   'Until   we   return \nafter   slaying   Jayadratha   you   should   not \nleave   Yudhishthira's   side.   Be   vigilant   in \nprotecting  him.  We  entrust  this  to  you  in \nconfidence   and   go.   There   is   only   one \nwarrior   in   the   Kaurava   army   whom   we \nfear,   and   he   is   Drona.   You   know   his \nsworn       intention.       We       go       leaving \nDharmaputra's   safety   in   our   hands.'   Thus \nsaid   Vasudeva   and   Arjuna   to   me   when \nthey   went.   Arjuna   laid   this   trust   on   me, \nbelieving    me    fit    for    it.    How    can    I \ndisregard  his  command?  Do  not  have  any \nfear   about   Arjuna's   safety.   No   one   can \ndefeat    him.    The    Sindhu    king    and    the \nothers  cannot  cope  with  a  sixteenth  part  of  \nArjuna.   Dharmaputra,   to   whom   shall   I \nentrust  your  safety  if  I  must  go?  I  see  no  \none  here  who  can  stand  against  Drona  if \nhe  comes  to  seize  you.  Do  not  ask  me  to  \ngo.   Consider   well   before   you   command \nme to leave.\"  \n\"Satyaki,\"    replied    Yudhishthira,    \"I    have \nthought   over   it.   As   I   have   weighed   the \ndanger    against    the    need    and    I    have \nconcluded   that   you   must   go.   You   leave \nme   with   my   full   permission.   Here   is   the \npowerful   Bhima   to   look   to   my   safety. \nThere   is   Dhrishtadyumna   also,   and   there \nare  many  others  besides.  There  is  no  need  \nto worry about me.\" \nSo   saying,   Yudhishthira   placed   a   boxful \nof  arrows  and  other  weapons  in  Satyaki's \nchariot  and  got  fresh  horses  yoked  thereto  \nand   sent   Satyaki   uttering   benedictions   on \nhim.  \n\n\"Bhimasena,   Yudhishthira   is   your   charge. \nBe   vigilant,\"   said   Satyaki,   and   went   to \njoin Dhananjaya. \nSatyaki   met   with   violent   resistance   as   he \nproceeded   to   dash   through   the   Kaurava \nforces.  But  he  cut  his  way  through  bearing \ndown   all   opposition.   But   the   resistance \nwas very stiff and his progress was slow.  \nWhen    Drona    saw    Satyaki    part    from \nYudhishthira,    he    began    to    assault    the \nPandava      formation      without      rest      or \ninterval,  until  it  began  to  break  and  retreat.  \nYudhishthira was greatly agitated. \n",

Our  foremost \nduty  is  to  protect  the  King.  But  I  must  also  \nobey  him  and  fulfil  his  command.  And  so \nI go, trusting him to your care.\" \n\"Bhima,  do  not  be  concerned.  Go  with  an \nassured      mind.      Drona      cannot      take \nYudhishthira     without     first     killing     me,\" \nsaid   the   heroic   son   of   Drupada,   sworn \nenemy    of    Drona.    And    Bhima    hurried \naway. \nThe   Kauravas   surrounded   Bhima   in   full \nforce   and   vowed   to   prevent   him   from \ngoing   to   Arjuna's   relief.   But   like   a   lion \nscattering   less   noble   beasts   he   put   his \nenemies    to    flight,    killing    no    less    than \neleven  of  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra.  Bhima  \nthen   approached   Drona   himself.   \"Stop,\" \ncried   Drona.   \"Here   I   am,   your   enemy. \nYou     cannot     proceed     further     without \ndefeating   me.   Your   brother   Arjuna   went \nin  with  my  consent.  But  I  cannot  let  you \ngo.\"   Drona   spoke   thus   believing   that   he \nwould   receive   the   same   courtesy   from \nBhima  as  he  did  from  Arjuna.  But  Bhima \nwas   furious   at   hearing   these   words   of \nDrona, and answered scornfully. \n\"Oh    brahmana,    it    was    not    with    your \npermission   that   Arjuna   went.   He   broke \nyour   resistance   and   pierced   your   battle \nlines  fighting  his  way  through,  but  he  did \nnot  hurt  you  out  of  pity.  But  I  shall  not, \nlike  Arjuna,  show  mercy  to  you.  I  am  your  \nenemy.  Once  upon  a  time,  you  were  our  \npreceptor  and  were  like  a  father  to  us.  We  \nrespected   you   as   such.   Now,   you   have \nyourself  said  you  are  our  enemy.  May  it \nbe    so!\"    Saying    this,    Bhima    aimed    his \nmace  at  Drona's  chariot  that  crumbled  to \npieces.  And  Drona  had  to  take  to  another  \nchariot.  \nThe   second   chariot   too   was   broken   to \npieces.     And     Bhima     forced     his     way \nthrough   overcoming   all   opposition.   Drona \n\nlost  eight  chariots  that  day.  And  the  army \nof   the   Bhojas,   that   tried   to   stop   Bhima, \nwas completely destroyed.  \nHe      proceeded      mowing      down      all \nopposition  and  reached  where  Arjuna  was  \nfighting Jayadratha's forces. \nAs  soon  as  he  saw  Arjuna,  Bhima  roared  \nlike  a  lion.  Hearing  that  roar,  Krishna  and  \nArjuna    were    exceedingly    pleased    and \nraised    yells    of    joy.    Yudhishthira    heard \nthese  roars  and,  relieved  of  his  doubts  and  \nanxieties,    he    pronounced    blessings    on \nArjuna. And he thought within himself:  \n\"Before  the  sun  sets  today,  Arjuna's  oath \nwill  be  fulfilled.  He  will  slay  the  man  who  \ncaused  Abhimanyu's  death  and  will  return \nin    triumph.    Duryodhana    may    sue    for \npeace  after  Jayadratha's  death.  Seeing  so \nmany   of   his   brothers   slain,   it   is   possible \nthat   foolish   Duryodhana   may   see   light. \nThe   lives   of   numerous   kings   and   great \nwarriors  have  been  sacrificed  on  the  field \nof    battle    and    even    the    stubborn    and \nnarrow-visioned    Duryodhana    may    now \nsee  his  fault  and  ask  for  peace.  Will  this \nindeed     happen?     The     great     grandsire \nBhishma   has   been   offered   as   a   sacrifice. \nWill   this   wicked   enmity   end   with   it   and \nshall    we    be    saved    from    further    cruel \ndestruction?\"  \nWhile     thus     Yudhishthira was     fondly \nhoping  and  dreaming  of  peace,  the  battle \nwas   raging   with   great   fury   where   Bhima, \nSatyaki   and   Arjuna   were   engaging   the \nenemy.  \nOnly  the  Lord  knows  through  what  travail \nthe   world   must   evolve.

      "content": "\nARJUNA   had  left  Yudhishthira  behind  to \nrepel   Drona's   attacks   and   had   gone   to \nmake   good   his   word   that   before   sunset \nJayadratha  would  lie  dead  on  the  field  of \nbattle.  \nJayadratha   had   been   the   main   cause   of \nAbhimanyu's   death.   He   it   was   who   had \neffectively      prevented      the      relief      of \nAbhimanyu  by  the  Pandavas,  and  thereby \ncaused      Abhimanyu      to      be      isolated, \noverpowered and slain. \nWe   have   seen   how   Yudhishthira   in   his \nanxiety  sent  first  Satyaki  and  then  Bhima \nto    join    Arjuna    in    his    battle    against \nJayadratha.   Bhima   reached   where Arjuna \nwas   engaged   and   sounded   his   simhanada \n(lion-roar).   Dharmaputra   heard   the   lion-\nroar  of  Bhima  and  knew  that  Arjuna  was \nfound alive. \nIt   was   the   fourteenth   day   and   the   battle \nraged   fiercely   at   many   points,   between \nSatyaki    and    Bhurisravas    at    one    place, \nbetween  Bhima  and  Karna  at  another  and  \nbetween Arjuna and Jayadratha at a third.  \nDrona  remained  at  the  main  front  resisting \nthe    attack    of    the    Panchalas    and    the \nPandavas,  and  leading  a  counter-offensive \nagainst them. \nDuryodhana  arrived  with  his  forces  at  the \nsector  where  Arjuna  attacked  Jayadratha, \nbut  was  soon  defeated  and  turned  back. \nThe   battle   thus   raged   long   and   furiously \non  more  than  one  front.  The  armies  were \nso  deployed  that  each  side  was  exposed  to  \ndanger in its rear.  \nDuryodhana was speaking to Drona:  \n\"Arjuna,   Bhima   and   Satyaki   have   treated \nus      with      contempt      and      proceeded \nsuccessfully    to    Jayadratha's    sector    and \nthey  are  pressing  hard  on  the  Sindhu  king.  \nIt    is    indeed    strange    that,    under    your \ncommand,   our   battle   array   should   have \nbeen   broken   and   our   plans   completely \nfoiled.   Everyone   asks   how   it   is   that   the \ngreat   Drona   with   all   his   mastery   of   the \nscience    of    war    has    been    so    badly \noutmaneuvered.     What     answer     shall     I \nmake? I have been betrayed by you.\" \nDuryodhana    thus,    once    again,    bitterly \nreproached        Drona,        who        replied \nunperturbed: \n\"Duryodhana,    your    accusations    are    as \nunworthy   as   they   are   contrary   to   truth. \n\nThere   is   nothing   to   be   gained   by   talking \nabout   what   is   past   and   beyond   repair. \nThink of what is to be done now.\" \n\"Sir,  it  is  for  you  to  advise  me.  Tell  me \nwhat   should   be   done.   Give   your   best \nconsideration    to    the    difficulties    of    the \nsituation   and   decide   and   let   us   do   it \nquickly.\"  Puzzled  and  perplexed,  thus  did \nDuryodhana plead. \nDrona  replied:  \"My  son,  the  situation  is  no  \ndoubt   serious.   Three   great   generals   have \nadvanced,    outmanoeuvring    us.    But    they \nhave  as  much  reason  to  be  anxious  as  we,  \nfor  their  rear  is  now  left  as  open  to  attack  \nas  ours.  We  are  on  both  sides  of  them  and  \ntheir   position   is   not   therefore   safe.   Be \nheartened,  go  up  to  Jayadratha  again,  and  \ndo  all  you  can  to  support  him.  It  is  of  no  \navail  to  dishearten  oneself  by  dwelling  on \npast   defeats   and   difficulties.   It   is   best   I \nstay  here  and  send  you  reinforcements  as \nand    when    required.    I    must    keep    the \nPanchalas    and    Pandava    army    engaged \nhere.    Otherwise,    we    shall    be    wholly \ndestroyed.\" \nAccordingly,   Duryodhana   went   with   fresh \nreinforcements  again  to  where  Arjuna  was \ndirecting his attack on Jayadratha.  \nThe    narrative    of    the    fourteenth    day's \nfighting   at   Kurukshetra   shows   that,   even \nin    the    Mahabharata    times,    the   modern \ntactics      of      turning      and      enveloping \nmovements was not unknown. \nThe  advantages  and  risks  of  such  strategy \nappear  to  have  been  fully  understood  and \ndiscussed   even   in   those   days.   Arjuna's \nflanking       manoeuvres       perplexed       his \nenemies   greatly.   The   story   of   that   day's \nbattle   between   Bhima   and   Karna   reads \nvery    much    like    a    chapter    from    the \nnarrative of a modern war.  \nBhima   did   not   desire   to   fight   Karna   or \nremain   long   engaged   with   him.   He   was \neager   to   reach   where   Arjuna   was.   But \nRadheya  would,  by  no  means,  permit  him \nto   do   this.   He   showered   his   arrows   on \nBhimasena      and      stopped      him      from \nproceeding.  \nThe   contrast   between   the   two   warriors \nwas   striking.   Karna's   handsome   lotus-like \nface   was   radiant   with   smiles   when   he \nattacked    Bhima    saying:    \"Do    not    show \nyour   back,\"   \"Now,   do   not   flee   like   a \ncoward,\" and so on.  \nBhima  was  all  anger  when  taunted  in  this \nmanner.   He   was   maddened   by   Karna's \nsmiles.   The   battle   was   fierce   but   Karna \ndid   everything   with   a   smiling   air   of   ease \nwhereas   Bhima's   face   glowed   with   rage \nand his movements were violent.  \nKarna  would  keep  at  a  distance  and  send  \nhis   well-aimed   shafts   but   Bhima   would \ndisregard   the   arrows   and   javelins   failing \nthick   upon   him   and   always   try   to   close \nwith Karna.  \nRadheya   did   everything   he   did,   calmly \nand      with      graceful      ease,      whereas \nBhimasena      fumed      and      fretted      with \nimpatience,    as    he    showed    his    amazing \nstrength of limb.  \nBhima   was   red   with   bleeding   wounds   all \nover  and  presented  the  appearance  of  an \nAsoka  tree  in  full  blossom.  But  he  minded  \nthem   not,   as   he   attacked   Karna   cutting \nbows in twain and smashing his chariot.  \nWhen  Karna  had  to  run  for  a  fresh  chariot,  \nthere  was  no  smile  on  his  face.  For  anger  \nrose  in  him,  like  the  sea  on  a  full  moon \nday,  as  he  attacked  Bhima.  Both  showed \nthe   strength   of   tigers   and   the   speed   of \neagles  and  their  anger  was  now  like  that \nof serpents in a fury.  \nBhima   brought   before   his   mind   all   the \ninsults    and    injuries    which    he    and    his \nbrothers   and   Draupadi   had   suffered,   and \nfought desperately, caring not for life.  \nThe   two   cars   dashed   against   each   other \nand    the milk   white   horses   of   Karna's \nchariot    and    Bhimasena's    black    horses \njostled   in   the   combat   like   clouds   in   a \nthunderstorm.  \n\nKarna's    bow    was    shattered    and    his \ncharioteer    reeled    and    fell.    Karna    then \nhurled    a    javelin    at    Bhima.    But    Bhima \nparried    it    and    continued    pouring    his \narrows   on   Karna,   who   had   taken   up   a \nfresh bow. \nAgain    and    again    did    Karna    lose    his \nchariot.   Duryodhana   saw   Karna's   plight \nand  calling  his  brother  Durjaya  said:  \"This \nwicked   Pandava   will   kill   Karna.   Go   at \nonce  and  attack  Bhima  and  save  Karna's \nlife.\" \nDurjaya   went   as   ordered and   attacked \nBhima   who,   in   a   rage   sent   seven   shafts \nwhich    sent    Durjaya's    horses    and    his \ncharioteer   to   the   abode   of   Yama   and \nDurjaya himself fell mortally wounded.  \nSeeing  his  bleeding  body  wriggling  on  the \nground  like  a  wounded  snake,  Karna  was  \noverwhelmed  with  grief  and  circled  round \nthe   hero,   paying   mournful   honor   to   the \ndead. \nBhima  did  not  stop  but  continued  the  fight  \nand   greatly   harassed   Karna.   Karna   once \nagain  had  to  find  a  fresh  chariot.  He  sent  \nwell  aimed  shafts  and  hit  Bhima  who  in  a  \nfury   hurled   his   mace   at   Karna   and   it \ncrashed  on  Karna's  chariot  and  killed  his \ncharioteer    and    horses    and    broke    the \nflagstaff.  Karna  now  stood  on  the  ground \nwith bent bow.  \nDuryodhana   now   sent   another   brother   to \nrelieve         Karna.         Durmukha         went \naccordingly and took Karna on his chariot.  \nSeeing   yet   another   son   of   Dhritarashtra \ncome  to  offer  himself  up  to  death,  Bhima \nlicked   his   lips   in   gusto   and   sent   nine \nshafts   on   the   newly   arrived   enemy.   And, \neven  as  Karna  climbed  up  to  take  his  seat  \nin    the    chariot,    Durmukha's    armor    was \nbroken and he fell lifeless. \nWhen   Karna   saw   the   warrior   bathed   in \nblood  and  lying  dead  by  his  side,  he  was  \nagain   overwhelmed   with   grief   and   stood \nmotionless for a while.  \nBhima  relentlessly  continued  his  attack  on \nKarna.  His  sharp  arrows  pierced  Karna's \ncoat of armor and he was in pain.  \nBut  he  too  at  once  returned  the  attack  and  \nwounded Bhima all over.  \nStill   the   Pandava   would   not   stop   and \nattacked  Karna  furiously.  The  sight  of  so \nmany   of   Duryodhana's   brothers   dying   for \nhis  sake  one  after  another  was  too  much \nfor Karna. \nThis,   and   the   physical   pain   of   his   own \nwounds   made   him   lose   courage   and   he \nturned   away   defeated.   But,   when   Bhima \nstood   up   on   the   field   of   battle   red   with \nwounds   all   over   like   a   flaming   fire   and \nemitted   a   triumphant   yell,   he   could   not \nbrook it but returned to the combat. \n",

Bhima   too   was \nmore   violent   than   before,   thinking   of   all \nthe   evil   that   Karna   had   wrought   against \nthe Pandavas.  \nHe  used  his  bow  so  as  to  disarm  Karna \ncompletely.    His    horses    and    charioteer \nwere   also   laid   low.   Karna   now   jumped \ndown   from   his   chariot   and   hurled   his \nmace at Bhima.  \nBut  Bhima  warded  it  off  with  shafts  from \nhis  powerful  bow  and  covered  Karna  with \na  shower  of  arrows  and  forced  him  to  turn  \nback and walk on foot. \nDuryodhana,   who   watched   this   combat, \nwas  greatly  grieved  and  sent  seven  of  his \nbrothers    Chitra,    Upachitra,    Chitraksha, \nCharuchitra,    Sarasana,    Chitrayudha    and \nChitravarman, to relieve Radheya.  \nThey    gave    battle    to    Bhima    displaying \ngreat  skill  and  energy.  But  fell  dead  one \nafter   another,   for   Bhima's   passion   was \nroused and his attack was irresistible.  \nWhen  Karna  saw  so  many  of  the  sons  of \nDhritarashtra     sacrificing     themselves     for \nhim,  his  face  was  wet  with  tears  and  he \nmounted   a   fresh   chariot   and   began   to \nattack Bhima with deadly effect.  \nThe  two  combatants  clashed  like  clouds  in \na    thunderstorm.    Kesava,    Satyaki    and \nArjuna   were   filled   with   admiration   and \njoy as they watched Bhima fighting.  \nBhurisravas,     Kripacharya,     Aswatthama, \nSalya,  Jayadratha  and  many  other  warriors  \nof    the    Kaurava   army   also   broke   into \nexclamations,   astonished   at   the   way   in \nwhich Bhima fought.  \nDuryodhana   was   stung   to   the   quick   and \nburned   with   anger.   Karna's   plight   caused \nhim   extreme   anxiety.   He   feared   Bhima \nwould   kill   Radheya   that   day,   and   sent \nseven  more  of  his  brothers  directing  them \nto     surround     Bhima     and     attack     him \nsimultaneously. \nThe   seven   brothers   sent   by   Duryodhana \nattacked  Bhima.  But  fell  one  after  another,  \nstruck  down  by  his  arrows.  Vikarna,  who  \nwas killed last, was beloved of all.  \nWhen   Bhima   saw   him   fall   dead   after   a \nbrave   fight,   he   was   deeply   moved   and \nexclaimed:   \"Alas,   O   Vikarna,   you   were \njust   and   knew   what   was   dharma!   You \nfought   in   loyal   obedience   to   the   call   of \nduty.  I  had  to  kill  even  you.  Indeed  this \nbattle  is  a  curse  upon  us  wherein  men  like  \nyou   and  the  grandsire  Bhishma  have  had \nto be slaughtered.\" \nSeeing   Duryodhana's   brothers,   who   came \nto  help  him,  slain  one  after  another  in  this  \nmanner,    Karna    was    overwhelmed    by \nanguish.  He  leant  back  on  his  seat  in  the \nchariot  and  closed  his  eyes  unable  to  bear  \nthe sight.  \nThen  recovering  control  over  his  emotions \nhe  hardened  his  heart  and  began  again  his  \nattack   on   Bhima.   Bow   after   bow   was \n\nbroken    up    by    Bhimasena's    shaft,    but \nKarna kept the battle.  \nEighteen  times  he  had  to  take  up  a  fresh \nbow.   Karna   had   long   ago discarded   his \nsmile   and   his   face   showed   savage   anger \neven  as  Bhima's.  They  now  glared  fiercely \nat each other as they fought.  \nYudhishthira  now  heard  Bhima's  roar  rise \nabove  the  tumult  of  battle,  and  heartened \nby   it,   he   fought   Drona   with   increased \nvigor.  \nIn  the  renewed  and  fierce  battle  between \nBhima   and   Karna,   Bhima   lost   his   horses \nand  charioteer.  Soon  his  chariot  also  was \nsmashed   to   pieces.   Then,   Bhima   hurled \nhis  spear  at  Karna  who  was  in  his  chariot  \nand   as   Karna   parried   it   with   his   shaft, \nBhima advanced with sword and shield.  \nBut  Karna  broke  the  shield  at  once  with \nhis  shafts.  Then,  Bhima  whirled  his  sword \nand  hurled  it,  and  it  cut  Karna's  bow  into  \ntwo   and   fell   on   the   ground.   But   Karna \ntook   up   yet   another   bow   and   assailed \nBhima    with    arrows    more    fiercely than \nbefore.  \nBhima,   in   a   fit   of   uncontrollable   rage, \nsprang  upon  Karna.  Radheya  took  cover \nbehind      his      flagstaff      and      escaped \ndestruction.    Thereupon,    Bhima    jumped \nout  of  Karna's  car  down  into  the  field  of \nbattle  where,  deprived  of  all  arms,  he  used  \nthe  elephants  lying  dead  on  the  ground  to  \nprotect   himself   from   Karna's   arrows   and \ncontinued the fight.  \nHe  picked  up  anything  he  could  lay  hands  \nupon,  wheels  of  broken  chariots,  the  limbs  \nof   horses   and   elephants   that   were   lying \nabout,   and   hurling   them   at   Karna,   kept \nhim    engaged    without    interval.    But    this \ncould   not   long   continue   and   Bhima   was \nsoon  at  a  great  disadvantage.  Karna  said \nexultingly:  \n\"Foolish   glutton,   you   do   not   know   the \nscience    of    war;    why    do    you    engage \nyourself   in   battle   here?   Go   to   the   jungle \nand  fill  yourself  with  fruits  and  roots  and \ngrow   fat.   You   are   a   savage,   not   fit   for \nkshatriya     battle.     Get     away!\"     Hurling \ninsulting    taunts    at    him,    he    made    the \nhelpless     Bhima     burn     with     rage,     but \nmindful   of   his   word   to   Kunti,   refrained \nfrom killing him.  \n\"There,   Arjuna!   See   how   poor   Bhima   is \nbeing   harassed   by   Karna,\"   said   Krishna. \nDhananjaya's  eyes  burned  red  with  wrath, \nwhen   he   saw   the   plight   of   his   valiant \nbrother. \nHe  bent  his  Gandiva  bow  and  discharged \nhis   arrows   on   Karna   who   then   gladly \nturned    his    attentions    from Bhima    to \nArjuna.  He  had  pledged  his  word  to  Kunti  \nnot  to  kill  more  than  one  of  the  Pandavas  \nand  he  reserved  that  option  for  the  great \nArjuna.  \n",

Drona    is    there    ever    seeking    an \nopportunity  to  seize  Dharmaputra.  Satyaki \nshould   have   stuck   to   his   post   there   to \nguard  him.  Instead,  he  has  come  here.  Old  \nBhurisravas    has    intercepted    Satyaki.    It \nwas   a   great   mistake   for   Yudhishthira   to \nhave sent Satyaki away here.\" \nThere     was     a     family     feud     between \nBhurisravas   and   Satyaki   that   made   them \ninveterate foes.  \nIt  had  come  about  this  way.  When  Devaki,  \nwho  was  to  be  the  blessed  mother  of  Sri \nKrishna,    was    a    maiden,    many    princes \ncompeted  for  her  hand  and  there  was  a \ngreat   battle   between   Somadatta   and   Sini \nover it. \nSini  won,  and  on  behalf  of  Vasudeva  he \nplaced  Devaki  in  his  chariot  and  took  her  \naway.   Since   that   incident   there   was   feud \n\nbetween  the  two  clans,  the  Sini  family  and  \nthat    of    Somadatta.    Satyaki    was    Sini's \ngrandson.  \nBhurisravas   was   Somadatta's   son.   When \nthey   found   themselves   on   opposite   sides \nin   the   Kurukshetra   battle,   it   was   natural \nthat,  as  soon  as  Bhurisravas  saw  Satyaki, \nthe    old    warrior    challenged    Satyaki    to \nbattle.  \n\"Oh   Satyaki,\"   cried   Bhurisravas,   \"I   know \nyou  strut  about  thinking  yourself  a  man  of \ngreat  prowess.  Here  now  I  have  you  in  my  \npower  and  will  presently  finish  you.  Long \nhave    I    sought    for    this    meeting.    Like \nIndrajit       destroyed       Dasaratha's       son \nLakshmana,  you  will  die  today  and  go  to \nthe  abode  of  Yama,  gladdening  the  hearts  \nof many a bereaved widow.\" \nSatyaki   laughed.   \"Have   done   with   your \nvaunting,\"   he   interrupted.   \"Words   are   not \ndeeds   and   do   not   frighten   fighting   men. \nDemonstrate  your  valor  in  action  and  do \nnot   indulge   in   dry   thunder   like   autumn \nclouds.\"  \nAfter   this   exchange   of   words,   the   battle \nbegan,   and   the   combat   was   as   between \ntwo  fierce  lions.  Their  horses  were  killed, \ntheir   bows   were   broken,   and   both   were \nrendered chariotless.  \nThey   were   now   standing   on   the   ground \nfighting   with   swords   and   shields,   till   their \nshields   were   hacked   to   bits   and   their \nswords  broken.  Then  they  were  locked  in \na deadly embrace without weapons.  \nThey  rolled  together  on  the  ground.  They \nleaped  up  and  they  sprang  on  each  other.  \nThey  fell  down  again  and  so  the  combat \nwent on for a long while. \nPartha's  mind  was  at  the  time  concentrated  \non  Jayadratha's  movements  and  he  did  not  \nwatch   this   combat   between   Satyaki   and \nthe son of Somadatta.  \nBut   his   charioteer   Krishna   was   deeply \nconcerned     about     Satyaki's     fate.     For \nKrishna knew about their family feud. \n\"Dhananjaya,\"    said    Krishna,    \"Satyaki    is \nexhausted.    Bhurisravas    is    going    to    kill \nhim now.\" \nStill       Arjuna       was       following       only \nJayadratha's movements.  \n\"Satyaki   who   came   after   an   exhausting \nbattle   with   the   Kaurava   forces   has   been \nforced   to   accept   Bhurisravas'   challenge,\" \nsaid  Krishna  again.  \"It  is  a  most  unequal \nbattle.    Unless    we    help    him,    beloved \nYuyudhana will be slain.\" \nEven     as     Krishna     was     saying     this, \nBhurisravas  lifted  Satyaki  up  and  brought \nhim   crashing   to   the   ground   and   all   the \nmen     around     in     the     Kaurava     army \nexclaimed: \"Yuyudhana is dead!\"  \nAgain    Krishna    importuned:    \"Satyaki    is \nlying   almost   dead   on   the   field,   the   best \namong  the  Vrishni  clan.  One  who  came  to  \nhelp  you,  is  being  killed  before  your  eyes.  \nYou are looking on, doing nothing.\" \nBhurisravas   caught   hold   of   the   prostrate \nSatyaki  and  dragged  him  on  the  ground  as  \na lion drags its elephant prey. \nArjuna   was   in   a   great   conflict   of   mind. \n\"Bhurisravas  has  not  been  called  to  battle \nby  me,  nor  has  he  challenged  me  to  fight.  \nHow  can  I  send  my  shaft  at  Bhurisravas \nwhen   he   is   engaged   with   another?   My \nmind  recoils  from  such  an  act,  although  it \nis  true  a  friend  who  came  to  help  me  is \nbeing slaughtered before my eyes.\" \nJust    as    Arjuna    finished    saying    this    to \nKrishna,  the  sky  was  darkened  by  a  cloud  \nof    arrows    sent    by    Jayadratha.    Arjuna \nreplied   with   a   shower   of   arrows,  but  he \nconstantly    turned    with    pain    to    where \nSatyaki    was    in    the    mortal    grip    of \nBhurisravas. \nKrishna  again  pressed  Arjuna  to  consider \nSatyaki's    condition.    \"O    Partha,    Satyaki \nhas  lost  all  his  weapons  and  he  is  now  in \nBhurisravas' power, helpless.\" \nWhen   Arjuna  turned,  he  saw  Bhurisravas \nwith   his   foot   on   the   prostrate   body   of \nSatyaki and sword upraised to slay him.  \n\nBefore  Bhurisravas  could  deliver  the  fatal \nthrust,   Arjuna   shot   an   arrow   which   went \nwith   the   speed   of   lightning   and   the   next \nmoment   the   uplifted arm  fell  chopped  off \nto   the   ground   still   holding   the   sword. \nBhurisravas,   all   amazed,   turned   and   saw \nwho had done it. \n\"Son  of  Kunti,\"  he  exclaimed,  \"I  had  not \nexpected   this   of   you!   It   befits   not   a \nwarrior    to    shoot    from    behind    in    this \nmanner.   I   was   engaged   in   combat   with \nsomeone  else  and  you  have  attacked  me \nwithout  notice.  Indeed,  then,  no  man  can \nresist  the  evil  influence  of  the  company  he  \nkeeps,     as     your     unchivalrous     conduct \nproves.  Dhananjaya,  when  you  go  back  to  \nyour   brother   Dharmaputra,   what   account \nare you  going  to  give  him  of  this  valorous  \ndeed.  Ah!  Who  taught  you  this  low  trick,  \nArjuna?   Did   you   learn   this   from   your \nfather  Indra  or  from  your  teachers  Drona \nand  Kripa?  What  code  of  conduct  was  it  \nthat  permitted  you  to  shoot  your  arrow  at  \na  man  who  was  engaged  in  combat  with \nanother  and  could  not  so  much  as  turn  his  \neyes  on  you?  You  have  done  the  deed  of  a  \nlow-bred    fellow    and    foully    besmirched \nyour     honor.     You     must     have     been \ninstigated  into  it  by  the  son  of  Vasudeva. \nIt  was  not  in  your  own  nature  to  do  it.  No \none  with  princely  blood  in  his  veins  would  \nthink  of  such  a  dastardly  deed.  I  know  you  \nhave     been     incited     to     it     by     that \ncontemptible Krishna.\"  \nThus   did   Bhurisravas   with   his   right   arm \ncut    off,    bitterly    denounce    Krishna    and \nArjuna in the Kurukshetra field. \nSaid  Partha:  \"Bhurisravas,  you  are  old  and  \nage  seems  to  have  affected  your  judgment.  \nYou   accuse   Hrishikesa   and   me   without \ncause.  How  could  I  look  on  doing  nothing,  \nwhen,  before  my  eyes,  you  were  in  the  act  \nof  killing  my  friend,  who  came  and  risked  \nhis   life   in   battle   on   my   behalf,   one   who \nwas  like  a  right  hand  to  me,  and  whom \nyou  were  going  to  stab  when  he  was  lying  \nhelpless   on   the   ground?   I   would   have \ndeserved  to  go  to  hell  if  I  had  failed  to \nintervene.  You  say,  I  have  been  ruined  by \nkeeping  company  with  Madhava.  Who  in \nthe  wide  world  would  not  wish  to  be  so \nruined?  You  have  spoken  out  of  confused  \nunderstanding.    Satyaki    who    was    weary \nand   exhausted   when   he   came   here   and \nwho     was     inadequately     armed,     was \nchallenged   by   you   to   give   battle.   You \novercame   him.   Having  been  defeated,  he \nlay  on  the  ground,  powerless.  What  code \nof  honor  enabled  you  to  raise  your  sword  \nto   thrust   it   into   the   body   of   the   fallen \nwarrior  and  slay  him?  Do  I  not  remember  \nhow  you  cheered  the  man  who  killed  my \nboy       Abhimanyu       when       he       stood \nstaggering,  exhausted  and  weaponless,  his \ncoat of armor torn off?\" \nBhurisravas  who  heard  this  did  not  answer  \nbut  spread  his  arrows  on  the  ground  with \nhis    left    hand    and    made    a    seat    for \nmeditation.  \nThe  old  warrior  sat  in  yoga  and  the  sight \ndeeply   moved   all   the   Kaurava   soldiers. \nThey    cheered    Bhurisravas    and    uttered \nreproaches against Krishna and Arjuna. \nArjuna  spoke:  \"Brave  men,  I  am  sworn  to  \nprotect   every   friend   within   bow-shot   of \nme  and  I  cannot  let  an  enemy  kill  him.  It  \nis  my  sacred  pledge.  Why  do  you  blame \nme?   It is   not   right   to   hurl   reproaches \nwithout due thought.\" \nAfter   saying   this   to   the   warriors   in   the \nfield   who   reproached   him,   he   turned   to \nBhurisravas  and  said:  \"O  excellent  among \nbrave  men,  you  have  protected  many  who  \nhave  gone  to  you  for  help.  You  know  that  \nwhat   has   happened   is   due   to   your   own \nerror.  There  is  no  justice  in  blaming  me.  If  \nyou   like,   let   us   all   blame   the   violence \nwhich governs kshatriya life.\" \nBhurisravas,   who   heard   this,   lowered   his \nhead in salutation. \nSatyaki  now  recovered  consciousness  and \nrose.  Carried  away  by  the  impetuosity  of \n\nhis   passion,   he   picked   up   a   sword   and, \nadvancing   to   Bhurisravas,   sitting   in   yoga \non   his   seat   of   arrows,   even   when   all \naround  were  shouting  in  horror  and  before  \nKrishna   and   Arjuna,   who   rushed   to   the \nspot,   could   prevent him,   with   one   swift \nand   powerful   cut,   he   struck   off   the   old \nwarrior's   head   which   rolled   down,   while \nthe    body    was    still    in    the    posture    of \nmeditation.  \nThe  gods  and  the  siddhas,  who  looked  on \nfrom      above      the      battlefield,      uttered \nblessings   on   Bhurisravas.   Everyone  in  the \nfield condemned Satyaki's act. \nSatyaki   maintained   he   was   right,   saying: \n\"After  I  fell  down  senseless,  this  enemy  of \nmy  family  placed  his  foot  on  my  prostrate  \nfigure  and  attempted  to  kill  me.  I  may  slay  \nhim  in  whatever  posture  he  might  choose \nto be.\" But none approved of his conduct. \nThe   slaying   of   Bhurisravas   is   one   of   the \nmany   situations   of   moral   conflict   woven \ninto    the    story    of    the    Mahabharata    to \ndemonstrate   that,   when   hatred   and   anger \nhave   been   roused,   codes   of   honor   and \ndharma are powerless to control them.  \n",

Within   the   little   time \nleft   before   nightfall,   I   do   not   think   it \npossible   for   Partha   to   reach   Jayadratha. \nYou,   Aswatthama,   Salya,   Kripa,   and   I \nmust  guard  Jayadratha  and  do  all  we  can \nto  see  that  he  does  not  fall  into  Arjuna's \nhands   during   the   next   few   hours   before \nsunset.\" \n\"My   king,\"   Karna   replied   \"I   have   been \nwounded  all  over  by  Bhimasena,  and  am \nso  weary  that  my  limbs  have  no  power  in \nthem.  Still,  I  shall  put  forth  all  the  strength \nthat is in me. I only live to serve you.\" \nWhen   Karna   and   Duryodhana   were   thus \nplanning,   Arjuna   was   engaged   in   a   great \nattack   on   the   Kaurava   army   and   putting \nforth  all  his  strength,  so  that  before  sunset  \nhe could break through to Jayadratha. \nKrishna  put  his  Panchajanya  in  his  mouth \nand   blew   a   loud   note   in   the   rishabha \nswara,  which  was  the  signal  for  his  own \ncharioteer   Daruka   to   arrive   at   once   with \nhis chariot.  \nWhen  it  came,  Satyaki  took  his  place  in  it,  \nand     attacked     Karna     vigorously     and \nskilfully,     keeping     him     fully     engaged. \nDaruka's  mastery  of  driving  and  Satyaki's \narchery   were   such   as   brought   down   the \ngods to witness the combat.  \nKarna's  four  chariot  horses  were  disabled \nand  the  charioteer  was  unseated.  Then  the  \nflagstaff   was   cut   asunder   and   the   chariot \nwas    smashed.    The    great    Karna    stood \nchariotless  and  the  event  produced  a  great  \nflutter in the Kaurava army.  \nKarna   had   to   run   and   climb   up   into \nDuryodhana's   chariot.   Sanjaya   here   tells \nDhritarashtra  to  whom  he  was  relating  the  \nincident:   \"The   greatest   adepts   in   archery \nare  Krishna,  Partha  and  Satyaki.  There is \nnot a fourth to match them!\"  \nArjuna     broke     through     the     Kaurava \nopposition      and      reached      Jayadratha. \nInflamed   by   the   thought   of   the   slaughter \nof   Abhimanyu,   and   all   the   great   wrongs \ninflicted   by   the   Kauravas,   Arjuna   fought \nwith fury.  \n\nSavyasachin   as   he   was,   he   discharged \nshafts   from   the   Gandiva   bow,   now   using \none  hand  and  now  the  other.  He  struck \nterror   and   confusion   among   his   enemies, \nwho   felt   as   if   Death   had   come   to   the \nbattlefield with wide-open jaws. \nIt  is  only  the  poet  of  the  Mahabharata  that  \ncan    describe    the    combat    that    raged \nbetween  Arjuna  and  Aswatthama  and  the \nother   great   warriors   that   protected   the \nking   of   Sindhu.   They   fought   fiercely   but \nwere   all   defeated   and   could   not   prevent \nArjuna    from    reaching    Jayadratha.    The \nattack  on  Jayadratha  began  and  the  battle \nraged   long.   Both   sides   were   constantly \nlooking    westwards,    for    the    day    was \nnearing   its   end.   The   Saindhava   was   no \nmean  foe,  and  taxed  to  the  full,  Arjuna's \nstrength and skill were hard put to it.  \nThe   sun   sank   towards   the   horizon   and \nreddened,   but   the   battle   did   not   cease. \n\"There   is   but   a   very   little   time   left.   It \nseems   Jayadratha   has   been   saved   and \nArjuna's  challenge  has  failed.  The  vow  is \nunfulfilled    and    Arjuna    is    going    to    be \ndisgraced,\"  said  Duryodhana  to  himself  in \ngreat glee. \nThen,  there  was  darkness  and  the  cry  went  \nround   in   both   armies:   \"It   is   sunset   and \nJayadratha  has  not  been  killed.  Arjuna  has  \nlost.\"   The   Pandavas   were   depressed   and \nthere  were  shouts  of  joy  in  the  Kaurava \narmy. \nJayadratha   turned   to   the   western   horizon \nand   thought   within   himself,  \"I  am  saved!\" \nfor  he  did  not  see  the  sun  then  and  thought  \nthe   time-limit  of  danger  from  Arjuna  was \nover.  \nAt  that  moment,  however,  Krishna  said  to  \nArjuna:   \"Dhananjaya,   the   Sindhu   raja   is \nlooking  at  the  horizon.  I  have  caused  this \ndarkness.  The  sun  is  still  up  and  has  not \nset.  Do  your  work.  This  is  the  moment  for  \nit, for Jayadratha is off his guard.\" \nA  shaft  flew  from  the  Gandiva  bow,  and, \nlike    a    vulture    swooping    down    on    a \nchicken,   carried   away   Jayadratha's   head. \n\"Listen,    Arjuna,\"    cried    Krishna,    \"send \nyour  shafts  in  swift  relays,  so  that  the  head  \nmay  be  supported  from  falling  to  the  earth \nand borne into Vriddhakshatra's lap.\"  \nAnd   Arjuna   sent   his   wonderful   arrows \nthat  carried  away  the  head  in  the  air.  It \nwas  a  strange  sight.  Vriddhakshatra  was  in  \nhis  ashrama  sitting  in  the  open absorbed  in  \nhis   evening   meditation   with   eyes   closed, \nwhen   his   son's   head   with   beautiful   black \nhair   and   golden   earrings   gently   dropped \ninto his lap.  \nThe   old   king   finished   his   meditation   and \ngot   up,   when   the   head   rolled   down   and \nfell    on   the   ground.   And,   as   ordained, \nVriddhakshatra's     head     burst     into     a \nhundred    fragments.    Jayadratha    and    his \nfather  together  reached  the  abode  of  the \nbrave. \nKesava,     Dhananjaya,     Bhima,     Satyaki, \nYudhamanyu   and   Uttamaujas   blew   their \nconchs   and   Dharmaraja   who   heard   the \ntriumphant   noise   knew   that   it   meant   that \nArjuna  had  redeemed  his  oath  and  that  the  \nSaindhava had been slain.  \nThen,   Yudhishthira   led   his   army   fiercely \nagainst  Drona.  It  was  nightfall,  but  on  the \nfourteenth   day   of   the   battle   the   rule   of \ncease-fire  at  sunset  was  not  observed.  As  \nthe  passions  rose  from  day  to  day,  one  by  \none the rules and restraints broke down. \n",

There  are  two  young  men \namong     the     Mahabharata     figures     who \nembody    all    the    qualities    of    heroism, \nfortitude,        strength,        courage,        and \namiability.      They      are      Arjuna's      son, \nAbhimanyu,         and         Bhima's         son, \nGhatotkacha.  Both  of  them  gave  up  their \nlives on the Kurukshetra battlefield. \nTowards      the      latter      part      of      the \nMahabharata   fight,   the   hatred   roused   on \n\nboth    sides    did    not    find    satisfaction    in \nbattle   conducted   during   the   daytime   and \nclose   at   nightfall.   On   the   fourteenth   day, \nwhen    the    sunset,    they    did    not    cease \nfighting but went on with it in torchlight. \nThe  Kurukshetra  field  presented  a  strange \nsight,  the  like  of  which  had  not  been  seen \nbefore   in   Bharatadesa.   The   generals   and \nsoldiers   on   both   sides   were   engaged   in \nbattle,   with   thousands   of   torches   burning \nand    using    signals    specially    devised    for \nnighttime. \nGhatotkacha  and  his  troops  of  asuras  who  \nare  strongest  at  night,  found  darkness  an \nadditional       advantage       and       violently \nattacked             Duryodhana's             army. \nDuryodhana's  heart  sank  within  him  when \nhe  saw  thousands  of  his  men  destroyed  by \nGhatotkacha  and  his  demon  army  moving \nin   the   air   and   attacking   in   weird   and \nunexpected ways.  \n\"Kill    this    fellow    at    once,    Karna,    for \notherwise,  soon  our  whole  army  will  cease  \nto   be.   Finish   him   without   further   delay.\" \nThus   begged   all   the   perplexed   Kauravas \nof Karna. \nKarna  was  himself  angry  and  bewildered, \nhaving  just  been  wounded  by  one  of  the \nasura's  arrows.  He  had  with  him  no  doubt  \nthe   spear   of   unerring   effect   which   Indra \nhad   given   to   him.   But   it   could   be   used \nonly  once,  and  he  had  carefully  husbanded  \nit  for  exclusive  use  on  Arjuna  with  whom \na     decisive     encounter     he     knew     was \ninevitable.  \nBut   in   the   confusion   and   wrath   of   that \neerie   midnight   melee,   Karna,   impelled   by \na   sudden   urge,   hurled   the   missile   at   the \nyoung  giant.  Thus  was  Arjuna  saved,  but \nat    great    cost.    Bhima's    beloved    son, \nGhatotkacha,     who     from     mid-air     was \nshowering    his    deadly    arrows    on    the \nKaurava   army,   dropped   dead,   plunging \nthe Pandavas in grief. \nThe  battle  did  not  stop.  Drona  spread  fear  \nand   destruction   in   the   Pandava   army   by \nhis   relentless   attacks.   \"O   Arjuna,\"   said \nKrishna,  \"there  is  none  that  can  defeat  this  \nDrona,    fighting    according    to    the    strict \nrules   of   war.   We   cannot   cope   with   him \nunless  dharma  is  discarded.  We  have  no \nother   way   open.   There   is   but   one   thing \nthat  will  make  him  desist  from  fighting.  If \nhe  hears  that  Aswatthama  is  dead,  Drona \nwill   lose   all   interest   in   life   and   throw \ndown     his     weapons.     Someone     must \ntherefore   tell   Drona   that   Aswatthama   has \nbeen slain.\"  \nArjuna  shrank  in  horror  at  the  proposal,  as  \nhe   could   not   bring   himself   to   tell   a   lie. \nThose   who   were   nearby   with   him   also \nrejected  the  idea,  for  no  one  was  minded  \nto be a party to deceit. \nYudhishthira   stood   for   a   while   reflecting \ndeeply.   \"I   shall   bear   the   burden   of   this \nsin,\" he said and resolved the deadlock! \nIt  was  strange.  But  when  the  ocean  was \nchurned  at  the  beginning  of  the  world  and  \nthe    dread    poison    rose    threatening    to \nconsume   the   gods,   did   not   Rudra   come \nforward  to  swallow  it  and  save  them?  To  \nsave  the  friend  who  had  wholly  depended  \non  him,  Rama  was  driven  to  bear  the  sin \nof  killing  Vali,  in  disregard  of  the  rules  of \nfairplay.   So   also,   now   did   Yudhishthira \ndecide  to  bear  the  shame  of  it,  for  there \nwas no other way. \nBhima  lifted  his  iron  mace  and  brought  it \ndown   on   the   head   of   a   huge   elephant \ncalled  Aswatthama  and  it  fell  dead.  After \nkilling        the        elephant        Aswatthama, \nBhimasena      went      near      the      division \ncommanded  by  Drona  and  roared  so  that \nall might hear.  \n\"I    have    killed    Aswatthama!\"    Bhimasena \nwho,  until  then,  had  never  done  or  even \ncontemplated   an   ignoble   act,   was,   as   he \nuttered these words, greatly ashamed.  \nThey  knocked  against  his  very  heart,  but \ncould   they   be   true?   Drona   heard   these \nwords  as  he  was  in  the  act  of  discharging \na  Brahmastra.  \"Yudhishthira,  is  it  true  my \n\nson   has   been   slain?\"   Dronacharya   asked \naddressing Dharmaputra.  \nThe    acharya    thought    that    Yudhishthira \nwould   not   utter   an   untruth,   even   for   the \nkingship of the three worlds. \nWhen   Drona   asked   thus,   Krishna   was \nterribly    perturbed.    \"If    Yudhishthira    fails \nus    now    and    shrinks    from    uttering    an \nuntruth,  we  are  lost.  Drona's  Brahmastra  is  \nof      unquenchable      potency      and      the \nPandavas will be destroyed,\" he said. \nAnd   Yudhishthira   himself   stood   trembling \nin  horror  of  what  he  was  about  to  do,  but  \nwithin   him   also   was   the   desire   to   win. \n\"Let  it  be  my  sin,\"  he  said  to  himself  and  \nhardened  his  heart,  and  said  aloud:  \"Yes, \nit    is    true    that    Aswatthama    has    been \nkilled.\"  \nBut,  as  he  was  saying  it,  he  felt  again  the  \ndisgrace   of   it   and   added   in   a   low   and \ntremulous       voice,       \"Aswatthama,       the \nelephant\"    words    which    were    however \ndrowned  in  the  din  and  were  not  heard  by  \nDrona. \n\"O  king,  thus  was  a  great  sin  committed,\" \nsaid   Sanjaya   to   the   blind   Dhritarashtra, \nwhile   relating   the   events   of   the   battle   to \nhim. \nWhen  the  words  of  untruth  came  out  of \nYudhishthira's   mouth,   the   wheels   of   his \nchariot,  which  until  then  always  stood  and  \nmoved  four  inches  above  the  ground  and \nnever  touched  it  at  once  came  down  and \ntouched the earth.  \nYudhishthira,    who    till    then    had    stood \napart   from   the   world   so   full   of   untruth, \nsuddenly  became  of  the  earth,  earthy.  He \ntoo   desired   victory   and   slipped   into   the \nway   of   untruth   and   so   his   chariot   came \ndown to the common road of mankind.  \nWhen   Drona   heard   that   his   beloved   son \nhad   been   slain,   all   his   attachment   to   life \nsnapped.  And  desire  vanished  as  if  it  had  \nnever  been  there.  When  the  veteran  was  in  \nthat     mood,     Bhimasena     loudly     spoke \nindicting him in harsh words:  \n\"You       brahmanas,       abandoning       the \nlegitimate    functions    of    your    varna    and \ntaking  to  the  Kshatriya  profession  of  arms,  \nhave    brought    ruin    to    princes.    If    you \nbrahmanas  had  not  gone  astray  from  the \nduties    belonging    to    you    by    birth,    the \nprinces   would   not   have   been   led   to   this \ndestruction.   You   teach   that   non-killing   is \nthe  highest  dharma  and  that  the  brahmana \nis   the   supporter   and   nourisher   of   that \ndharma.    Yet,    you    have    rejected    that \nwisdom    which    is yours   by   birth,   and \nshamelessly   undertaken   the   profession   of \nkilling.   It   was   our   misfortune   that   you \ndescended to this sinful life.\" \nThese     taunts     of     Bhimasena     caused \nexcruciating    pain    to    Drona    who    had \nalready  lost  the  will  to  live.  He  threw  his \nweapons  away  and  sat  down  in  yoga  on \nthe  floor  of  his  chariot  and  was  soon  in  a  \ntrance.  \nAt    this    moment    Dhrishtadyumna    with \ndrawn  sword,  came  and  climbed  in  to  the  \nchariot  and  heedless  of  cries  of  horror  and  \ndeprecation   from   all   around   he   fulfilled \nhis   destiny   as   the   slayer   of   Drona   by \nsweeping  off  the  old  warrior's  head.  And \nthe  soul  of  the  son  of  Bharadwaja  issued \nout  in  a  visible  blaze  of  fight  and  mounted  \nheavenwards. \nThe  Mahabharata  is  a  great  and  wonderful \nstory.    The    sorrows    of    human    life    are \npainted   with   sublime   beauty   and   rolled \nout  in  a  grand  panorama. Behind  the  story  \nof  errors  and  sorrows  the  poet  enables  us  \nto    have    a    vision    of    the    Transcendent \nReality.   Thus   it   is   that   the   Mahabharata, \nthough  a  story,  has  come  to  be  a  book  of  \ndharma.  This  book,  in  style  and  substance, \nis    altogether    different    from    tales    and \nromances.  In  modern  novels,  dramas  and \npictures,   exciting   scenes   are   enacted,   the \nhero      passes      through      dangers      and \ndifficulties   and   finally   marries   a   woman \nwhom  he  loves.  Or  else  everything  seems \nto   go   on   happily   but   suddenly   things   go \n\nwrong    and    terrible    misfortune    happens \nand   the   curtain   drops.   This   is   the   art \nscheme    of    ordinary    sensational    stories. \nThe   Ramayana   and   the   Mahabharata   are \nquite   a   different   kind   of   artistic   creation. \nWhen   we   read   them,   our   inner   being   is \nseized  and  cleansed,  so  to  say,  by  being \npassed     alternately     through     joys     and \nsorrows,   and   we   are   finally   lifted   above \nboth   and   taken   to   the   Transcendent   and \nReal.  \n",

      "content": "\nWHEN   Drona   died,   the   princes   of   the \nKaurava      army      installed Karna      as \nGeneralissimo.    Karna    stood    up    in    his \ngorgeous  war  chariot  driven  by  Salya.  The  \ndauntless   confidence   of   his   bearing   and \nhis   great   renown   as   a   warrior   heartened \nthe   Kauravas.   The   battle   again   began. \nReaders  of  the  stars  were  consulted  and \nthe  Pandavas  chose  the  propitious  hour  for  \ngrim    battle.    Arjuna    led    the    attack    on \nKarna,        supported        by        Bhimasena \nimmediately behind his chariot.  \nDuhsasana  made  a  concentrated  attack  on \nBhima   and   sent   a   shower   of   arrows   at \nhim.  Bhima  chuckled  and  said  to  himself. \n\"I  have  this  wretch  now  safe  in  my  hands.  \nI    shall    today    redeem    my    promise    to \nDraupadi.   Too   long   has   my   oath   waited \nfor performance.\" \nAs  Bhima  thus  bethought  himself  of  what \nDuhsasana   had   done   to   Draupadi,   the \nanger   within   him   blazed   up   uncontrollably \nand   throwing   down   all   his   weapons,   he \njumped   from   his   chariot   and   leapt   upon \nDuhsasana  like  a  tiger  on  its  prey,  hurled \nhim down and broke his limbs. \n\"Wicked  beast,  is  this  the  wretched  hand \nthat   held   Draupadi   by   the   hair?   Here,   I \ntear  out  the  root  from  your  body.  If  there  \nbe  any  here  wishing  to  help  you,  let  him \ncome forward and try!\" \nGlaring    hatefully    at    Duryodhana    as he \nroared    this    challenge,    Bhimasena    tore \nDuhsasana's    arm    out    and    threw    the \nbleeding limb on the battlefield.  \nAnd   then   he   fulfilled   the   terrible   oath  he \nhad  taken  thirteen  years  before.  He  sucked  \nand   drank   the   blood   from   his   enemy's \nbody  like  a  beast  of  prey  and  danced  on \nthe   bloody   field,   mad   with   passion.   \"I \nhave   done   it!\"   he   roared.   \"The   oath   I \nswore   against   this   great   sinner   has   been \nredeemed.   It only  remains  to  redeem  my \noath      as      regards      Duryodhana.      The \nsacrificial   fire   is   ready.   Let   that   victim \nalso prepare.\"  \nThe  scene  made  everyone  shudder.  Even \ngreat  Karna  was  shaken  as  he  saw  Bhima  \nin   this   ecstasy   of   wrath.   \"Do   not   flinch,\" \nsaid  Salya  to  Karna.  \"It  does  not  befit  you  \nto  show  any  sign  that  may  be  mistaken  for  \nfear.   When   Duryodhana   stands   quivering \nin   despair;   it   is   not   right   that   you   also \nshould     lose     heart.     After     the     great \nDuhsasana's  death,  the  army's  hope  rests \nsolely  on  you.  You  must  now  bear  the  full  \nburden.  Like  the  gallant  warrior  you  are, \nseek  single  combat  with  Arjuna,  and  win \neternal   glory   on   earth   or   the   soldier's \nheaven!\"  At  these  words,  Karna  recovered  \nhis  courageous  spirit.  With  eyes  red  with \nwrath   and   unshed   tears,   he   bade   Salya \ndrive the chariot towards Arjuna.  \n\"Enough    of    fighting,\"    said    Aswatthama \naddressing   Duryodhana   earnestly.   \"Let   us \nterminate   this   disastrous   enmity.   Beloved \nfriend,   make   peace   with   the   Pandavas. \nStop the battle.\" \n\"What?  Did  you  not  hear  the  words  that \nthe   stubborn   Bhima   uttered   when   like   a \nravening  beast,  he  drank  human  blood  and  \ndanced  over  my  brother's  mangled  body? \nWhat   talk   can   there   be   now   of   peace? \nWhy   do   you   speak   vain   words!\"   said \nDuryodhana.   Saying   thus,   he   ordered   a \nfresh   disposition   of   the   forces,   and   gave \nthe command for attack.  \nThen  followed  a  great  battle.  The  son  of \nSurya   sent   a   dazzling   arrow,   which   spat \n\nfire  and  made  for  Arjuna,  like  a  serpent \nwith   its   flaming   double-tongue   out.   Then \nKrishna,  Arjuna's  charioteer,  at  the  nick  of \ntime,    pressed    the    vehicle    down    five \nfingers   deep   in   the   mud,   so   that   the \nserpent  shaft  just  missed  Partha's  head  but  \nstruck  off  his  helmet!  Arjuna  was  red  with \nshame  and  anger  and  he  fixed  a  dart  on  his  \nbow to make an end of Karna.  \nAnd  Karna's  fated  hour  was  come,  and  as \nhad   been   foretold,   the   left   wheel   of   his \nchariot  suddenly  sank  in  the  bloody  mire. \nHe  jumped  down  on  the  ground  to  lift  the  \nwheel up from the mud. \n\"Wait   a   minute!\"   he   cried.   \"My   chariot \nhas  sunk  in  the  ground.  Great  warrior  as \nyou  are,  and  knowing  dharma  as  you  do,  \nyou     would     certainly     not     take     unfair \nadvantage     of     this     accident.     I     shall \npresently  set  my  car  right  and  give  you  all \nthe battle you want.\"  \nArjuna      hesitated.      Karna      was      now \nsomewhat   perturbed   on   account   of   the \nmishap.  He  remembered  the  curse  that  had \nbeen    pronounced    on    him,    and    again \nappealed to Arjuna's sense of honor. \nKrishna     intervened.     \"Ha,     Karna!\"     be \nexclaimed,    \"it    is    well    that    you    too \nremember    that    there    are    things    like \nfairplay  and  chivalry!  Now  that  you  are  in \ndifficulty,    you    remember    them indeed. \nBut    when    you    and    Duryodhana    and \nDuhsasana   and   Sakuni   dragged   Draupadi \nto  the  Hall  of  Assembly  and  insulted  her, \nhow  was  it  you  forgot  them  utterly?  You \nhelped  to  inveigle  Dharmaputra,  who  was \nfond   of   play   but   was   unskilled   at   it,   to \ngamble,  and  you  cheated  him.  Where  had  \nyour   fairplay   hidden   itself   then?   Was   it \nfairplay   to   refuse   to   give   to   Yudhishthira \nhis  kingdom  when  according  to  the  pledge  \nthe   twelve   years   of   forest   life   and   the \nthirteenth     year     incognito     were     duly \ncompleted?   What   had   happened   to   the \ndharma     you     appeal     for     now?     You \nconspired    with    the    wicked    men    who \nsought   to   poison   and   kill   Bhima.   You \nacquiesced    in    the    plot    to    burn    the \nPandavas    alive    when    sleeping    in    the \npalace  of  wax  into  which  they  had  been \nlured.  What  had  happened  to  dharma  all \nthat  time?  What  did  dharma  tell  you  when \nviolent  hands  were  laid  on  Draupadi  and \nyou   were   looking   on   enjoying   the   sight? \nDid   you   not   then   mock   at   her   saying: \n'Your  husbands  have  left  you  unprotected,  \ngo    and    marry    another    husband'?    The \ntongue  that  was  not  ashamed  to  utter  those  \nwords    now    talks    of    chivalry.    Chivalry \nindeed!  When  a  mob  of  you  surrounded \nthe    young    Abhimanyu    and    shamelessly \nslew  him,  was  that  chivalry?  Wicked  man,  \ndo  not  talk  now  of  chivalry  and  fairplay, \nfor you have never honored them!\"  \nWhen Krishna  was  denouncing  him  in  this  \nmanner  in  order  to  urge  Arjuna  to  prompt  \naction,  Karna  bent  his  head  in  shame  and  \nuttered not     a     word.     Karna     silently \nascended   the   chariot   leaving   the   wheel \nstill   stuck   in   the   mud   and   took   his   bow \nand  sent  an  arrow  at  Arjuna  with  unerring  \naim   and   such   power that   it   stunned   him \nfor a moment.  \nKarna   utilised   the   respite   won,   to   jump \ndown  again  and  hurriedly  tried  to  lift  the \nchariot  wheel  up.  But  the  curse  was  too \nstrong   for   him   and   fortune   had   deserted \nthe great warrior.  \nThe   wheel   would   not   budge,   though   he \nstrove  with  all  his  great  strength.  Then  he \ntried  to  recall  the  mantras  of  mighty  astras  \nhe   had   learnt   from   Parasurama,   but   his \nmemory   failed   in   the   hour   of   his   need, \neven as Parasurama had foretold.  \n\"Waste    no    more    time,    Arjuna,\"    cried \nMadhava.  \"Send  your  shaft  and  slay  your \nwicked enemy.\"  \nArjuna's   mind   was   wavering.   His   hand \nhesitated  to  do  what  was  not  chivalrous. \nBut  when  Krishna  said  this,  the  poet  says: \n\"Arjuna   accepted   this   command   of   the \n\nLord   and   sent   an   arrow   which   cut   and \nsevered the head of the Radheya.\"  \nThe  poet  had  not  the  heart  to  impute  this  \nact  to  Arjuna  who  was  the  embodiment  of  \nnobility.

They  supported  his  \nstand  and  they  chose  Salya  and  gave  him \nthe    supreme    command    from    then    on. \nSalya  was  mighty  of  limb  and  as  brave  as  \nany  of  the  warriors  who  had  been  killed. \nThe     army     was     arrayed     under     his \nleadership   and   the   battle   raged   fiercely. \nOn  the  side  of  the  Pandavas,  Yudhishthira  \nnow    led    the    attack    personally    against \nSalya.  It  astonished  everyone  to  see  how \nthe    man,    who    was    till    then    the    very \nincarnation    of    gentle    ness,    fought    so \nfuriously. \nThe   battle   was   equal   for   a   long   while, \nwhen   Yudhishthira   hurled   at   Salya,   his \nspear   that   went   straight   and   struck   him. \nLike   the   great   flagstaff   at   the   end   of   a \nfestive   function,   Salya's   body   lay   lifeless \non the field, crimson with blood.  \nWhen  Salya,  the  last  of  the  great  generals,  \nfell  dead,  the  Kaurava  army  lost  all  hope.  \nThe     surviving     sons     of     Dhritarashtra, \nhowever,    joined    together    and    attacked \nBhima   from   all   sides.   He   slew   them   all. \nThe    son    of    Vayu    had    nourished    his \nburning   anger   for   thirteen   years   from   the \ntime  Draupadi  was  insulted  in  the  Hall  of \nAssembly.   He   said   to   himself   now:   \"I \nhave   not   lived   in   vain,   but Duryodhana \nstill lives,\" and smiled grimly. \nSakuni    led    the    attack    on    Sahadeva's \ndivision.      After      a      while,      Sahadeva \ndischarged    a    sharp-edged    sword-arrow \nsaying:  \"Fool,  here  is  the  reward  for  your \ngreat  sin.\"  It  went  straight  and  cut  through \nSakuni's  neck  like  a  sword.  And  the  head,  \nwhich  was  at  the  root  of  all  the  wicked \ndeeds   of   the   Kauravas,   rolled   on   the \nground.  \nLeft   leaderless,   the   wreck   of   the   broken \narmy   scattered   and   fled   in   all   directions, \npursued  and  slaughtered  to  a  man  by  the \nexulting victors.  \n\"'Thus  utterly  was  destroyed  thine  army  of \neleven   Akshauhinis,   O!   Bharata,   out   of \n\nthe  thousands  of  kings,  who  espoused  thy \ncause    in    their    pride    and    might,    only \nDuryodhana     could     be     seen     on     that \nbattlefield,    fainting    and    sore    wounded,\" \nsaid  Sanjaya,  describing  the  debacle  to  the  \nblind king. \nAfter  doing,  in  vain,  all  he  could  to  rally \nhis     defeated     army,     Duryodhana,     left \nalmost    alone,    took    up    his    mace    and \nwalked   towards   a   pool   of   water.   His \nwhole   frame   was   burning   like   fire,   and \nwater   attracted   him.   \"The   wise   Vidura \nknew  what  would  happen  and  he  told  us,\" \nhe said to himself, as he entered the water. \nOf  what  avail  is  wisdom  that  comes  too \nlate?  What  has  been  done  must  produce  its  \nresult  that  has  to  be  suffered.  That  is  the \nlaw.  Yudhishthira  and  his  brothers  arrived \nthere   in   relentless,   pursuit   of   their   great \nenemy. \n\"Duryodhana!\"      exclaimed      Yudhishthira, \n\"after   destroying   family   and   tribe,   would \nyou   yourself   escape   death   by   concealing \nyourself  in  this  pond?  Where  is  your  pride  \nnow?  Have  you  no  shame?  Come  up  and  \nfight.  A  kshatriya  by  birth,  do  you  shrink \nbattle and death?\"  \nStung    to    the    quick    by    these    words, \nDuryodhana   replied   with   dignity:   \"I   have \nnot   come   here,   Dharmaputra,   a   fugitive \nfor  my  life.  It  was  not  fear  that  brought \nme  here.  I  stepped  into  the  water  to  cool \nthe  fire  that  is  raging  within  me.  I  neither \nfear   death   nor   wish   to   live,   but   why \nshould  I  fight?  The  earth  has  now  nothing \nleft  that  I  came  to  fight  for!  All  those  who  \nstood  by  me  have  been  slain.  My  desire \nfor  kingdom  is  gone.  I  leave  the  world  to  \nyou  without  a  rival.  Enjoy  it  in  undisputed  \nsovereignty.\" \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"Now,   that   is   really \ngenerous,   especially   after   you   said   you \nwould  not  allow  us  even  a  needle-point  of  \nland.   When   we   begged   for   peace   and \nentreated   you   to   give   us   a   portion,   you \nspurned  our  proposal.  Now,  you  say  we \nmay  take  it  all.  It  is  not  for  kingdom  or \nland  that  we  fight.  Must  I  recount  all  your  \nsins?   The   wrongs   you   did   us,   and   the \noutrage    you    perpetrated    on    Draupadi, \ncannot be expiated except with your life.\"  \nSanjaya,   who   related   the   events   to   the \nblind  old  king,  here  said:  \"When  your  son \nDuryodhana   heard   these   harsh   and   cruel \nwords  spoken  by  Dharmaputra,  he  at  once  \nrose from the water, mace in hand.\" \nStepping  out  of  the  pool,  the  unfortunate \nDuryodhana  said:  \"Come,  one  by  one,  all \nof   you,   for   I   am   single.   You   five   will \nsurely  not  join  together  and  attack  me  who  \nam   alone   and   without   armor,   weary   and \nwounded all over.\"  \nYudhishthira   replied   sharply:   \"If   indeed   it \nbe   wrong   for   many   to   join   together   and \nattack   a   single   person,   pray   tell   us how \nAbhimanyu  was  attacked  and  killed?  Did \nyou   not   consent   to   many   combining   and \nattacking    that    boy,    standing    all    alone \namidst  your  crowd?  Yes,  when  men  face \nmisfortune,   they   see   and   preach   dharma \nand  chivalry  to  others.  Wear  your  coat  of \narmor.   Choose   any   of   us   you   like   and \nfight.  Die  and  go  to  swarga  or  win  and  be  \nking.\" \nAccordingly,   the   combat   began   between \nBhima   and   Duryodhana.   Sparks   of   fire \nflew       when       their       maces       clashed. \nDuryodhana    and    Bhima    were    equal    in \nstrength   and   skill,   and   the   battle   raged \nlong,  and  the  issue  hung  doubtful.  Those, \nwho  stood  watching,  were  debating  as  to \nwhom  would  win.  Krishna  said  to  Arjuna \nthat   Bhima   would   redeem   the   oath   he \nswore  in  the  Hall  of  Assembly  and  smash \nDuryodhana's    thighs.    Bhima    heard    this \nand,   at   that   moment,  the  memory  of  the \ngreat outrage came vividly to his mind.  \nHe  leaped  like  a  lion  and  came  down  with  \nhis    mace    on    Duryodhana's    thighs    and \nbroke   them   and   Duryodhana   fell   heavily \non the ground, wounded to death.  \n\nBhima   jumped   on   the   prostrate   body   of \nhis  enemy,  stamped  on  his  head  with  his \nheavy foot and danced a terrible dance. \n\"Cease,   Bhima,\"   cried   Dharmaraja.   \"You \nhave  paid  off  the  debt.  Duryodhana  is  a \nprince  and  a  cousin.  It  is  not  right  to  put  \nyour foot on his head.\"  \nSaid  Krishna:\"Soon  the  wicked  man's  soul \nwill  depart  from  the  body.  Sons  of  Pandu,  \nDuryodhana   and   his   friends   have   been \nslain.    Why    linger    here?    On    to    your \nchariots.\" \nWhen   Krishna   said   this,   the   face   of   the \nfallen   Duryodhana   glowed   like   a   blazing \nfire   with   anger   and   hatred.   Turning   his \neyes towards Krishna be said:  \n\"By  base  tricks  you  contrived  the  death  of \nwarriors,  who  fought  bravely  according  to \nthe   laws   of   war.   You   could   not   have \ndreamt    of    victory    in    a    fair    fight    with \nKarna  or  Bhishma  or  Drona.  Have  you  not  \na spark of shame left?\" \nEven  dying,  Duryodhana  felt  no  regret  for \nall that he had done. \n\"Duryodhana,\"    said    Krishna,    \"vainly    do \nyou   accuse   others.   Greed   and   pride   of \npower   led   you   to   unnumbered   wicked \ndeeds and you are reaping as you sowed.\"  \n\"Wretch!\"   replied   Duryodhana.   \"Living,   I \nwas  a  great  prince,  generous  friend,  and  a  \nterrible  foe.  All  human  joys,  such  joys  as \nkings  wish  for  in  vain,  and  even  Gods  do  \nnot    despise,    have    been    mine,    in    their \nfullness.   A   warrior's   death   is   the   fitting \ncrown    of    such    a    life.    Dying,    I    go \ntriumphantly  to  swarga  to  join  my  friends \nand   my   brothers   who   have   gone   there \nalready   and   are   waiting   to   welcome   me. \nYou    remain    here    below,    your    objects \ndefeated    and    yourselves    the    object    of \ncontempt  of  all  kshatriyas.  I  do  not  mind \nBhima  putting  his  foot  on  my  head  as  I  lie  \nhelpless   on   the   ground   with   legs   broken. \nWhat  care  I?  In  a  few  minutes  more  will \nnot  the  feet  of  crows  and  vultures  settle  on  \nmy head?\"  \nWhen  Duryodhana  said  this,  flowers  were \nshowered  down  from  the  heavens  by  the \ngods.   Inordinate   desire   took   Duryodhana \ninto  the  wrong  path,  whence  ensued  anger  \nand  numerous  breaches  of  dharma.  But  no  \none    could    question    the    unconquerable \nspirit of Dhritarashtra's son. \n",

      "content": "\nWHEN   the   war   was   nearing   its   end, \nBalarama    arrived    at    Kurukshetra    after \ncompleting   his   tour   of   holy   places.   He \ncame   just   when   Bhima   and   Duryodhana \nwere  engaged  in  their  last  mortal  combat. \nHe   saw   Bhima   aiming   the   deadly   blow \nwhich  broke  Duryodhana's  thighs,  and  his \nanger  flamed  up  at  this  great  breach  of  the  \nrules of single combat. \n\"Fie   upon   you   all!   Would   any   kshatriya \nhit    below    the    navel?    This    Bhima    has \noffended   the   law   most   disgracefully,\"   he \nexclaimed  and  impatiently  going  up  to  his \nbrother Krishna, shouted:  \n\"You  can  look  on  and  tolerate  all  this.  But  \nI    cannot    bear    to    see    such    unclean \nfighting!\"      Saying      this      he      advanced \ntowards      the      offending      Bhima      with \nupraised      plough.      The      plough      was \nBalarama's  weapon  on  supreme  occasions,  \nas  the  discus  was  Krishna's.  Krishna  was \nalarmed   when   he   saw   his   elder   brother \nadvancing in a passion towards Bhima.  \nHe   rushed   forward   and,   intercepting   him, \nsaid:   \"The   Pandavas   are   our   friends   and \nclosest    relations.    They    have    been    the \nvictims    of    insufferable    wrongs    at    the \nhands    of    Duryodhana.    When    Draupadi \nwas  insulted  in  the  Assembly  Hall,  Bhima \nvowed:  'I  will  one  day  in  battle  break  the  \ntwo  thighs  of  Duryodhana  with  this  mace \nand   kill   him.'   He   proclaimed   this   solemn \noath  at  that  time  and  everyone  has  known \nit.  It  is  the  duty  of  a  kshatriya  to  fulfil  the  \nvow   he   has   solemnly   taken.   Do   not   let \nyour   anger   mislead   you   and   do   not   be \nunjust    to    the    innocent    Pandavas.    You \nshould,   before   condemning   Bhima,   take \n\ninto    account    all    the    wrongs    that    the \nKauravas   have   done   to   the   Pandavas. \nNothing    but    error    can    result    if    one \nproceeds  to  judge  conduct  without  taking \ninto   account   the   chain   of   events   leading \nup  to  it.  You  cannot  snatch  a  particular  act  \nout   of   its   context   and   proceed   to   give \njudgment     on     it     alone     without     gross \ninjustice.   The   era   of   Kali   has   arrived, \nwhen  the  laws  of  a  previous  age  cannot \napply.   It   was   not   wrong   for   Bhima   to \nstrike  below  the  navel  an  enemy  who  had  \nwickedly    contrived    against    his    life    on \nmany    occasions.    It    was    because    of \nDuryodhana's   foul   instigation   that   Karna \nsent    a    shaft    from    behind    and    broke \nAbhimanyu's    bowstring    when    he    was \ndefending    himself    against    heavy    odds. \nArjuna's    young    son    was    attacked    by \nnumerous   warriors   who   surrounded   him, \nwhen  he  stood  all  by  himself  in  the  field, \ndeprived   of   bow   and   chariot,   and   in   a \nmost     cowardly     manner,     killed     him. \nDuryodhana    thought    evil    and    practised \ndeception   from the   time   of   his   birth   and \nhas   brought   about   the   destruction   of   his \npeople.   There   is   no   sin   in   Bhima   killing \nthis   man.   Bhima   bore   the   wrongs   done \nand    kept    his    wrath    within    himself    for \nthirteen    long    years.    Duryodhana    knew \nwell   that   Bhima   had   sworn   to   break   his \nthighs   and   kill   him.   When   he   challenged \nthe  aggrieved  Pandavas  to  battle,  he  knew \nvery   well   that   he   invited   Bhima   to   make \ngood  his  oath.  How  can  you  think  that  it \nwas wrong for Bhima to do this?\" \nKrishna's      words      did      not      change \nBalarama's      opinion,      but      his      anger \nsubsided.    \"Duryodhana    will    attain    the \nhappy    regions    reserved    for    the    brave. \nBhima's   fame   has   been   tarnished   for   all \ntime.  It  will  be  said  among  men  that  the \nson   of   Pandu   broke   the   laws   of   war   in \nattacking     Duryodhana.     It     will     remain \nforever  a  great blot  on  his  good  name.  I \nhate  to  stay  here  any  longer.\"  So  saying \nthe    indignant    Balarama    immediately    left \nfor Dwaraka.  \n\"Yudhishthira, why this strange silence?\" \nasked Krishna.  \n\"O   Madhava,   it   hurts   me   to   see   Bhima \nleap    on    cousin    Duryodhana's    mortally \nwounded  body  and  trample  on  his  head.  I  \nsee  the  end  of  the  glory  of  our  race.  We  \nwere  wronged  by  the  Kauravas.  I  know \nthe   full   measure   of   grief   and   anger   in \nVrikodara's  heart,  and  don't  wish  to  blame  \nhim    beyond    reason.    We    have    killed \nDuryodhana,     who     was     afflicted     by \nuncontained      greed      and      poverty      of \nunderstanding.    What    serves    it    now    to \ndebate the  ethics  of  it  or  nicely  to  weigh \nthe   propriety   of   a   much   wronged   man's \nrevenges?\" \nYudhishthira    was    greatly oppressed    in \nmind.    When    men transgress    the    law, \nextenuations   and   excuses   are   of   no   avail \nin giving mental satisfaction.  \nArjuna,  of  penetrating  intellect,  was  silent. \nHe  did  not  show  approval  of  Bhima's  act.  \nNor    did    he    say    anything    by    way    of \ndetraction.   The   rest   of   the   people,   who \nwere     there,     were     however     loud     in \ncondemnation   of   Duryodhana   and   were \nreminding  one  another  of  all  his  misdeeds \nand   errors.   Krishna   turned   towards   them \nand said:  \n\"Warriors,  it  is  not  proper  that  we  go  on \nspeaking  against  an  enemy  who  has  been \ndefeated   and   is   lying   mortally   wounded. \nWe  should  not  speak  ill  of  a  dying  man. \nHe  was  stupid  and  brought  about  his  own \nend.  He  fell  into  the  company  of  bad  men \nand was ruined. Let us go.\"  \nDuryodhana,   who   was   stretched   on   the \nground   in   intense,   agony,   when   he   heard \nKrishna  say  this,  went  into  a  paroxysm  of  \nrage.  He  half  raised  himself  on  his  arms  in \nspite     of     the     excruciating     pain,     and \nexclaimed: \n\"Wretch!   Son   of   a   slave!   Was   not   your \nfather  Vasudeva  Kamsa's  slave?  You  have  \n\nno  business  to  sit  or  move  with  princes. \nYou  speak  like  a  shameless  wretch.  I  saw \nyou  instigate  Bhima  to  aim  his  blow  at  my \nthigh!   Do   you   think   I   did   not   see   you, \nmaking    as    though    casually    talking    to \nArjuna,   pointing   to   your   thigh,   but   really \nindicating   to   Bhima   that   he   should   strike \nme  on  the  thighs,  disregarding  the  laws  of \nsingle  combat?  Till  then  it  had  been  equal \nbattle.   You   have   neither   pity   nor   shame. \nDid   you   not   contrive   the   death   of   the \ngrandsire     Bhishma     through     stratagem? \nYou   advised   Sikhandin   to   be   placed   in \nfront    when    attacking    Bhishma,    knowing \nthat  the  grandsire  would  scorn  to  fight  a \nwoman,  and  would  let  himself  be  mortally \nwounded   without   resistance.   You   brought \nabout   the   end   of   Dronacharya   through \nmaking    Dharmaputra    utter    a    falsehood. \nYou  were  the  father  of  that  deadly  lie  that  \nissued    from    Yudhishthira's    mouth,    and \nmade   Dronacharya   throw   his   bow   away. \nDid  you  not  look  on  without  protest,  and \nrejoice,           when           that,           wretch \nDhrishtadyumna   attacked   and   killed   the \nacharya     who     had     stopped     fighting, \nthrowing   away   his   weapons,   and   settled \ndown   in   yoga   posture   for   meditation   on \nthe    Supreme?    Was    it    not    you    who \nwickedly   contrived   to   make   Karna   hurl \nthe  fatal  spear  at  Ghatotkacha  instead  of \nreserving  it  for  Arjuna  as  he  had  all  along \nresolved  to  do?  O  great  sinner,  surely  it \nwas  you  who  instigated  Satyaki  to  butcher  \nBhurisravas   when   his   right  arm  had  been \nfoully  cut  off  and  he  stopped  fighting  and \nspread   his   arrows   for   a   seat   for   holy \nmeditation.  It  was  you  who  brought  about  \nthe  death  of  Karna  by  inducing  Arjuna  to  \nattack  him  in  a  cowardly  manner  when  he  \nwas   engaged   in   lifting   his   chariot   wheel \nwhich  had  sunk  and  stuck in  the  mud  in \nthe  field  of  battle.  Oh  worthless  man,  sole  \ncause  of  our  destruction,  the  whole  world \nhas  condemned  your  act  when  by  sorcery \nyou  made  it  appear  as  if  the  sun  had  set.  \nYou made   Jayadratha,   the   Sindhu   king, \nbelieve that  the  day  was  over  and  he  was  \npast  danger,  and  thus  he  was  slain  when \nhe was off his guard.\" \nThus       did       Duryodhana       pour       his \ndenunciation    against    Krishna    and    then, \nexhausted  by  the  pain  of  his  wounds  and \nthe  violence  of  his  rage,  he  fell  prostrate \nagain. \n\"Son  of  Gandhari,\"  said  Krishna,  \"why  do  \nyou  let  your  anger  add  to  the  pain  of  your  \nlast   moments?   It   is   your   own   misdeeds \nthat  have  brought  about  your  end.  Do  not  \nattribute  it  to  me.  Bhishma  and  Drona  had  \nto  die  on  account  of  your  sins.  So  also \nwere  you  the  cause  of  the  death  of  Karna  \nand  others.  Need  I  recount  all  the  wrongs  \nthat  you  were  guilty  of  against  the  sons  of \nPandu?    What    punishment    can    be    too \nsevere   for   the   great   outrage,   which   you \ninflicted    on    Draupadi?    The    animosities \nand    passions    that    resulted    from    your \nmisdeeds    cannot    be    made    ground    for \ncondemning    others.    All    the    deceptions \nand  lapses  you  charge  us  with  were  forced  \non  us  by  reason  of  your  wicked  conduct.  \nYou   have   paid   off   on   the   battlefield   the \ndebt  incurred  by  your  greed.  But  you  are  \ndying  the  death  of  a  brave  man.  You  will \ngo   to   the   happy   regions   reserved   for \nkshatriyas  who  lay  down  their  lives  on  the  \nfield of battle.\"  \n\"Krishna,  I  go  to  swarga  with  my  friends \nand   relatives.   But   you   and   your   friends \nwill   live   on   earth   to   suffer,\"   said   the \nstubborn     Duryodhana.     \"I     studied     the \nVedas.  I  have  given  gifts  ordained  by  law \nand  I  have  reigned  supreme  over  all  the \nsea-girt  earth.  While  I  lived,  I  stood  upon \nthe   humbled   heads   of   foes.   All   human \njoys,  such  joys  as  even  the  Gods  cannot \ndespise   and   kings   sigh   for   in   vain,   the \nvery  pinnacle  of  power,  were  mine.  Dying \nnow,   such   death   as   warriors   deem   the \ncrown   of   kshatriya   life,   I   go   to   meet   in \nheaven    my    friends    and    brothers    gone \n\nbefore,   eager   to   welcome   me.   Who   is \nmore   blest,   I,   or   you   who,   doomed   to \nlinger     here,     mourning     for     slaughtered \nfriends   in   desolate   homes,   find   the   long \nsought  triumph  but  ashes  in  your  mouth?\" \nsaid  Duryodhana.  And  the  gods  showered  \nflowers  down  on  the  dying  warrior  and  the  \ngandharvas  played  music  and  the  sky  was  \nilluminated.   Vasudeva   and   the   Pandavas \nfelt small.  \n\"There   is   truth,\"   said   Krishna,   \"in   what \nDuryodhana   said.   You   could   not   have \ndefeated  him  by  fair  means.  This  wicked \nman was invincible in battle.\" \n",

      "content": "\nWHEN        Aswatthama        heard        how \nDuryodhana    lay    mortally    injured,    and \nlearnt    the    details    of    the    combat,    his \nrighteous  anger  swelled  like  the  sea.  The \ndeception,   practised   by   the   Pandavas   in \norder  to  bring  about  his  father's  end,  had \nbeen rankling in his mind.  \nNow,   when   he   learnt   how   Duryodhana \nhad   been   stricken   down   mortally   against \nall  rules  of  chivalry,  he  went  to  the  spot \nwhere   Duryodhana   was   lying   and   there \ntook  an  oath  that  he  would  that  night  send  \nthe Pandavas to the abode of Yama. \nDuryodhana,  who  was  in  the  last  physical \nagony   of   departing   life,   was   transported \nwith  joy when  he  heard  Aswatthama  take  \nthis   oath.   He   immediately   ordered   those \nwho   stood   nearby   to   install   Aswatthama \nas  Supreme  Commander  of  the  Army  with \ndue   ceremony   and,   when   that   was   over, \nsaid to Him: \"All my hopes are in you.\" \nIt  was  sunset  and  the  forest  was  in  utter  \ndarkness   when   under   a   big   banian   tree \nKripacharya,   Kritavarma   and   Aswatthama \nhalted   for   rest.   They   were   so   greatly \nfatigued   that   Kripacharya   and   Kritavarma \nfell fast asleep as soon as they lay down.  \nBut   Aswatthama   did   not   get   sleep,   for \nsorrow,     indignation     and     hatred     burnt \nwithin  him.  He  was  listening  to  the  noises \nthat    the    nocturnal    birds    and    prowling \nbeasts    began    to    make    as    the    night \nadvanced.   He   was   turning   over   in   his \nmind    how    to    execute    his    promise    to \nDuryodhana. \nOn  the  branches  of  the  banian  tree,  under  \nwhich    the    three    warriors    were    resting, \nhundreds  of  crows  roosted.  They  were  all \nquiet  and  asleep  until  a  big  owl  came  and  \nbegan  to  attack  the  birds  one  after  another  \nand  kill  them.  When  Aswatthama  saw  the \nnocturnal   bird   of   prey   tear   the   helpless \ncrows,   he   got   an   idea.   The   crows   that \ncould   not   see   at   night   flew   round   and \nround   helplessly   and   fell   victims   to   the \nowl that attacked them violently. \n\"These  wicked  Pandavas  and  the  Panchala  \nthat     killed     my     father     and     all     their \nsupporters  can  easily  be  killed  by  us,  if  we  \nsurprise   them   when   they   are   sleeping   in \ntheir   tents   at   night   even   as   this   owl   is \nattacking   these   blind   crows.   Thus   can   I \navenge  the  deeds  of  foul  play  they  have \npractised  on  us.  I  am  deeply  indebted  to \nthis   bird   of   prey   from   whom   I   have \nreceived  the  teaching.  There  is  no  offence \nin   adopting   plans   to   suit   one's   altered \ncircumstances.   If   we   can   lawfully   attack \nan  enemy,  when  his  army  is  tired  or  when \nhis  forces  are  scattered,  why  then  should \nnot  we,  who  have  lost  our  armies,  attack \nour  enemies  when  they  are  asleep?  There \ncan   be   nothing   wrong   in   it.   Indeed   it   is \nonly   thus   that   we   can   punish   and   defeat \nthese     Pandavas     who     have     achieved \nsuccesses  through  foul  play.    We  have  no  \nother course open.\"  \nAswatthama   made   up   his   mind   and   he \nimmediately    woke    up    Kripacharya    and \ninformed   him   of   his   plan.   Kripacharya, \nwho heard it, was astonished.  \n\"This  can  never  be,\"  said  he.  \"It  is  wholly \nwrong.  To  attack  men  who  have  retired  to  \nsleep,   has   never   been   done   before.   It \nwould  be  an  unprecedented  crime  against \nthe       laws       of       kshatriya       conduct. \nAswatthama,   for   whom   are   we   fighting? \n\nThe  man  for  whose  sake  we  joined  in  this  \nwar  has  been  fatally  wounded  and  his  end  \nhas    arrived.    We    have    discharged    our \nobligations   most   loyally.   We   fought   our \nbest    for    the    greedy    and    wrongheaded \nDuryodhana    but    we    failed    irretrievably. \nThere  is  no  purpose  now  in  our  continuing \nthe  fight  and  it  is  folly  to  do  so.  Let  us  go  \nto      Dhritarashtra      and      the      faultless \nGandhari,    and    place    ourselves    at    their \ndisposal.   Let   us   take   counsel   of   wise \nVidura also.   They   will   tell   us   what   lies \nbefore us to do.\" \nWhen        Kripacharya        spoke        thus, \nAswatthama's       grief       and       indignation \nincreased and he spoke bitterly: \n\"Everyone  feels  sure  that  what  he  thinks  is  \nthe   only   right   and   proper   thing   to   do. \nOne's   understanding   naturally   limits   one's \nvision.   These   Pandavas   have   been   guilty \nof   the   foulest   conduct.   They   killed   my \nnoble   and   trustful   father   through   a   lie. \nThey   have   killed   Duryodhana   against   the \nlaws  of  chivalry.  I  have  no  doubt  in  my \nmind  that  what  I  propose  to  do  is  quite \nproper  vengeance  for  all  these  foul  deeds.  \nIt  is  only  if  I  carry  out  this  plan  that  I  can  \npossibly  repay  my  debt  to  my  king  and  to  \nmy  father.  I  have  decided  on  it  and  I  do  \nnot  propose  to  alter my  plan.  I  am  going \ntonight    to    the    tents    where    they    are \nsleeping   having cast   off   their   armor   and \nthere    I    will    kill    the    Pandavas    and \nDhrishtadyumna while they are asleep.\"  \nKripacharya   was   deeply   grieved   to   hear \nAswatthama     speak     thus:     \"You     have \nattained   a   great   name   among   men,\"   he \npleaded,  \"Your  spotless  character  will   by \nthis   be   blemished,   even   like   a   milk-white \ncloth  bespattered  with  blood.  Never  could  \nit   be   right   to   kill   sleeping   men.   Desist \nfrom this.\"  \n\"Sir,     what     are     you     talking?     These \nPandavas   butchered   my   father   when   he \nhad  thrown  away  all  his  weapons  and  had  \nsat   down   in   prayer.   These   men   have \nbreached  the  embankment  of  dharma  and \nreleased   the   flood,   and   not   a,   drop   of \ndharma  is  now  left!  Karna,  who  was  on \nthe   ground   putting   right   the   wheel   of   his \nchariot,   was   murdered   by   these   lawless \nrascals.    Bhima    has    killed    Duryodhana \nwith    a    blow    below    the    navel.    What \ndharma  has  been  left  for  us  to  follow?  The  \nPandavas  have,  once  for  all,  destroyed  the  \nwall   of   dharma.   Why   should   we   make \nresearch    into    law    and    chivalry    when \ndealing    with    these    ruffians    who    have \nattained   successes  by  destroying  both?  If \nby    killing    the    sleeping    Panchalas,    who \nbutchered    my    great    father,    I    may    be \ndoomed  to  rebirth  in  the  body  of  a  foul \nbird  or  of  a  wriggling  worm,  I  do  not  care.  \nI seek such a birth!\"  \nSaying   this   and,   without   waiting   for   an \nanswer, Aswatthama  proceeded  to  harness  \nhis   horses   and   get   his   chariot   ready   to \nstart.    When    he    was    about    to    leave \nKripacharya  and  Kritavarma  cried:  \"Stop. \nWhat    are    you    resolved    upon    doing, \nAswatthama?   We   cannot   approve   of   it, \nbut   neither   can   we   desert   you   in   your \ndesperate   enterprise.   The   path   you   are \nbent  on  treading,  we  shall  also  follow.  The  \nsin   you   are   resolved   upon,   let   us   share \nalso.\"  So,  they  went  along  with  him.  Thus  \ndoes  evil  grow!  One  transgression  begets \nthe   next   and   thus   evil   grows   from   evil \nsubmerging righteousness.    Evil    flourishes \non retaliation. \nThey      reached      the      Pandava      camp. \nDhrishtadyumna  had  doffed  his  armor  and \nwas  plunged  in  deep  slumber  in  his  tent. \nAswatthama  leapt  on  the  sleeping  warrior \nand,   before   he   could   put   himself   into   a \nposture  of  defence,  cruelly  kicked  him  to \ndeath. \nThe     same     process     was     relentlessly \nrepeated  until  all  the  Panchalas  and  all  the  \nsons  of  Draupadi  were  killed  one  by  one \nwhen  they  were  plunged  in  sleep  in  their \ntents. \n\nAfter   having   done   this   deed,   the   like   of \nwhich   had   never   before   been   considered \npossible    among    kshatriyas,    Kripacharya, \nKritavarma  and  Aswatthama  came  out  of \nthe  tents  and  set  fire  to  the  camp.  When \nthe  fire  spread,  the  sleeping  soldiers  were \nawakened   and   fled   hither   and   thither   in \nconfusion,   even   like   the   crows   on   the \nbanian  tree  under  which  they  had  rested  in  \nthe    forest,    and    they    were    mercilessly \nslaughtered by Aswatthama. \n\"We      have      done      our      duty,\"      said \nDronacharya's   son.   \"Let   us   go   and   give \nthe  glad  news  to  Duryodhana,  if  we  can \nreach  him,  before  he  expires.  Let  him  die  \npleased.\"  \nThe   three   of   them   accordingly   hurried   to \nDuryodhana. \n",

With  many \nthousands         of         bereaved         women \naccompanying,   Dhritarashtra   went   to   the \nfield  of  battle.  At  Kurukshetra,  the  scene \nof    terrible    destruction,    the    blind    king \nthought  of  all  that  had  passed,  and  wept \naloud.

It  is  now  \ntime   that   you   should   arrange   for   proper \nfuneral    ceremonies    for    the    dead,\"    said \nSanjaya to Dhritarashtra.  \n\"It  is  not  right  to  grieve  for  those  who  die  \nin    battle.    When    souls    have    left    their \nbodies,   there   is   nothing   like   relationship, \nnothing   like   brother   or   son   or   relative. \nYour  sons  have  really  no  connection  with \nyou.   Relationship   ends   with   death,   being \nonly    a    bodily    connection    and    a    mere \nminor   incident   in   the soul's   eternal   life. \nFrom   the   nowhere   do   lives   come,   and, \nwith    death, they    again    disappear    into \nnowhere.  Why  should  we  weep  for  them?  \nThose  who  die  in  battle  after  a  heroic  fight  \ngo  as  guests  to  receive  Indra's  hospitality. \nGrieving  for  what  is  past,  you  cannot  gain \nanything  in  the  nature  of  dharma,  pleasure \nor  wealth.\"  Thus,  and  in  many  more  ways,  \ndid   the   wise   and   good   Vidura   try   to \nassuage the king's grief.  \nVyasa     also     approached     Dhritarashtra \ntenderly   and   said:   \"Dear   son,   there   is \nnothing  that  you  do  not  know  and which \nyou   have   to   learn   from   me.   You   know \nvery   well   that   all   living   beings   must   die. \nThis   great   battle   came   to   reduce   earth's \nburden  as  I  have  heard  from  Lord  Vishnu \nHimself.   That   is   why   this   calamity   could \nnot         be         prevented.         Henceforth, \nYudhishthira   is   your  son.  You  should  try \nto   love   him   and   in   that   way   bear   the \nburden of life, giving up grief.\" \nMaking   his   way,   through   the   crowd   of \nweeping   women   Yudhishthira   approached \nDhritarashtra    and    bowed    before    him. \nDhritarashtra   embraced   Yudhishthira,   but \nthere was no love in that embrace. \nThen   Bhimasena   was   announced   to   the \nblind king. \"Come,\" said Dhritarashtra. \nBut  Vasudeva  was  wise.  He  gently  pushed  \nBhima   aside   and   placed   an   iron   figure \nbefore    the    blind    Dhritarashtra,    knowing \nthe       old       king's       exceeding       anger. \nDhritarashtra   hugged   the   metal   statue   to \nhis  bosom  in  a  firm  embrace  and  then  the  \nthought  came  to  him  of  how  this  man  had  \nkilled  everyone  of  his  sons.  And  his  wrath \nincreased   to   such   a   pitch   that   the   image \nwas crushed to pieces in his embrace.  \n\"Ha!   My   anger   has   deceived   me,\"   cried \nDhritarashtra. \"I have killed dear Bhima.\" \nThen Krishna said to the blind king:  \n\"Lord,  I  knew  that  it  would  be  thus  and  I  \nprevented    the    disaster.    You    have    not \nkilled   Bhimasena.   You   have   crushed   only \nan  iron  image  that  I  placed  instead  before  \nyou.   May   your   anger   be   appeased   with \nwhat  you  have  done  to  this  image.  Bhima  \nis still alive.\"  \nThe  king  was  composed  somewhat  and  he  \nblessed   Bhima   and   the   other   Pandavas \nwho  then  took  leave  of  him  and  went  to \nGandhari. \nVyasa       was       with       Gandhari.       \"Oh \nqueen,\"said   the   rishi,   \"be   not   angry   with \nthe  Pandavas.  Did  you  not  tell  them  even \nwhen   the   battle   began:   'Where   there   is \ndharma,  there  surely  will  be  victory'?  And  \nso  it  has  happened.  It  is  not  right  to  let  the  \nmind   dwell   on   what   is   past   and   nurse \none's   anger.   You   must   now   call   to   aid \nyour great fortitude.\" \nGandhari  said:  \"Bhagavan,  I  do  not  envy \nthe  victory  of  the  Pandavas.  It  is  true  that  \n\ngrief  for  the  death  of  my  sons  has  robbed  \nme  of  my  understanding.  These  Pandavas \nalso  are  my  sons.  I  know  that  Duhsasana \nand  Sakuni  brought  about  this  destruction \nof   our   people.   Arjuna   and   Bhima   are \nblameless.  Pride  brought  this  battle  about \nand   my   sons   deserve   the   fate   they   have \nmet.  I  do  not  complain  about  it.  But  then,  \nin    Vasudeva's    presence,    Bhima    called \nDuryodhana    to   battle   and   they   fought. \nAnd,     knowing     that     Duryodhana     was \nstronger   and   could   not be   defeated   in \nsingle   combat,   Bhima   struck   him   below \nthe   navel   and   killed   him.   Vasudeva   was \nlooking  on.  This  was  wrong  and  it  is  this \nthat I find it impossible to forgive.\" \nBhima,   who   heard   this,   came   near   and \nsaid:  \"Mother,  I  did  this  to  save  myself  in \nbattle.  Whether  it  was  right  or  wrong,  you \nshould    bear    with    me.    Your    son    was \ninvincible  in  combat  and  so  I  did  in  self-\nprotection   what   was   undoubtedly   wrong. \nHe     called     Yudhishthira    to    play    and \ndeceived  him.  We  had  been  wronged  by \nyour  son  in  so  many  ways.  He  would  not  \ngive  back  the  kingdom,  of  which  be  took  \nunlawful  possession.  And  you  know  what \nyour  son  did  to  blameless  Draupadi.  If  we  \nhad  killed  your  son  on  the  spot,  when  he  \nmisbehaved    in    the    Hall    of    Assembly, \nsurely   you   would   not   have   blamed   us. \nBound      by      Dharmaraja's      vow,      we \nrestrained    ourselves    with    difficulty    then. \nWe   have   since   discharged   honor's   debt \nand   found   satisfaction   in   battle.   Mother, \nyou should forgive me.\" \n\"Dear  son,  if  you  had  left  but  one  out  of \nmy   hundred   sons   and   killed   all   the   rest \nand   satisfied   your   anger,   I   and   my   old \nhusband  would  have  found  solace  in  that \nsurviving   son   for   the   rest   of   our   lives. \nWhere   is   Dharmaputra?   Call   him.\"   She \nsaid. \nHearing  this,  Yudhishthira  trembled  as  he, \nwith  clasped  hands,  approached  Gandhari, \nwhose  eyes  were  bound  in  a  cloth  in  loyal  \nlifelong      penance      for      her      husband's \nblindness.  He  bowed  low  before  her  and \nsaid softly: \n\"Queen,     the     cruel     Yudhishthira,     who \nkilled  your  sons,  stands before  you  fit  to \nbe    cursed.    Do    curse    me    who    have \ncommitted  great  sin.  I  care  not  for  life  or  \nfor   kingdom.\"   Saying   this,   he   fell   on   the \nground and touched her feet.  \nGandhari   heaved   a   deep   sigh   and   stood \nmute.  She  turned  her  head  aside  knowing \nthat   if,   through   the   cloth   with   which   her \neyes   were   bound,   her   vision   fell   on   the \nprostrate     Yudhishthira     he     would     be \nreduced  to  ashes  on  the  spot.  But  through \na   little   space   in   the   cloth,   even   as   she \nturned  her  face  away,  her  eyes  fell  on  the  \ntoe  of  the  prostrate  Yudhishthira.  At  once,  \nsays the poet, the toe was charred black.  \nArjuna    knew    the    power    of    bereaved \nGandhari's   wrath,   and   hid   himself   behind \nVasudeva.   The   wise   and   good   Gandhari \nsuppressed  all  her  anger  and  blessed  the \nPandavas and sent them to Kunti.  \nGandhari  turned  to  Draupadi,  who  was  in \nlamentation,    having    lost    all    her    sons. \n\"Dear    girl,\"    said    Gandhari.    \"Do    not \ngrieve.  Who  can  give  solace  to  you  and \nme?  It  is  through  my  fault  that  this  great \ntribe has been destroyed altogether.\"  \n",

Are  \nyou happy?\" he asked.  \nYudhishthira   replied:   \"Bhagavan,   it   is   true \nthe      kingdom      has      come      into      my \npossession.  But  my  kinsmen  are  all  gone. \nWe   have   lost   sons   that   were   dear.  This \nvictory  appears  to  me  but  a  great  defeat.  O  \n\nNarada,  we  took  our  own  brother  for  an \nenemy   and   killed   him,   even   Karna   who \nstood  rooted  like  a  rock  in  his  honor  and  \nat  whose  valor  the  world  wondered.  This \nterrible   act   of   slaying   our   own   brothers \nwas the  result  of  our  sinful  attachment  to \nour  possessions.  Karna,  on  the  other  hand,  \nkept  the  promise  he  gave  to  our  mother \nand  abstained  from  killing  us.  Oh!  I  am  a  \nsinner,   a   low   fellow   who   murdered   his \nown  brother.  My  mind  is  troubled  greatly \nat  this  thought.  Karna's  feet  were  so  much  \nlike   our   mother's   feet.   In   the   large   hall, \nwhen   that   great   outrage   was   committed \nand  my  anger  rose,  when  I  looked  at  his \nfeet,  which  were  so  much  like  Kunti's  feet,  \nmy  wrath  subsided.  I  remember  that  now \nand my grief increases.\"  \nSo   saying,   Yudhishthira   heaved   a   deep \nsigh.  Narada  told  him  all  about  Karna  and  \nthe   curses   that   had   been   pronounced   on \nhim on various occasions.  \nOnce,  when  Karna  saw  that  Arjuna  was \nsuperior  to  him  in  archery,  he  approached  \nDrona  and  entreated  him  to  teach  him  how  \nto   wield   the   Brahmastra.   Drona   declined \nsaying  it  was  not  open  to  him  to  instruct \nany  but  a  brahmana  of  faultless  conduct  or  \na   kshatriya   who   had   purified   himself   by \nmuch  penance.  Thereupon,  Karna  went  to  \nthe      Mahendra      hills      and      deceived \nParasurama    by    saying    that    he    was    a \nbrahmana   and   became   his   disciple.   From \nhim  he  obtained  instruction  in  archery  and \nthe use of many astras.  \nOne  day,  when  Karna  was  practising  with \nhis   bow   in   the   forest   near   Parasurama's \nasrama,      a      brahmana's      cow      was \naccidentally   hit   and   killed.   The   brahmana \nwas  angry  and  uttered  a  curse  on  Karna: \n\"In  battle,  your  chariot  wheels  will  stick  in \nthe  mud  and  you  will  be  done  to  death, \neven   like   this   innocent   cow   which   you \nhave killed.\"  \nParasurama     was     exceedingly     fond     of \nKarna   and   taught   him   all   the   archery   he \nknew   and   instructed   him   fully   in   the   use \nand the withdrawing of the Brahmastra.  \nOne  day,  however,  he  discovered  that  the  \ndisciple  was  not  a  brahmana.  It  happened  \ntha   an   an   insect   bit   a   hole   into   Karna's \nthigh  when  one  afternoon the  teacher  had  \nfallen  asleep  on  Karna's  lap.  Karna  bore \nthe  acute  pain  quietly  and  did  not  stir,  lest  \nthe   master   should   wake   up.   The   warm \nblood  trickling  from  the  wound  woke  up \nParasurama.    When    he    saw    what    had \nhappened, he was angry. \n\"You  are  a  kshatriya;  otherwise  you  could  \nnot  have  borne  this  physical  pain  without \nstirring.  Tell  me  the  truth.  You  are  not  a \nbrahmana.     You     have     deceived     your \nteacher.   Fool!   When   your   hour   comes, \nyour  knowledge  of  astras  will  fail  you  and  \nwhat   you   have   learnt   from   me   through \ndeception will not avail you.\" \nParasurama's   wrath   against   kshatriyas   is \nwell  known  and,  when  he  discovered  that \nKarna  was  a  kshatriya,  he  cursed  him  thus  \nin his anger. \nKarna  was  free  in  making  gifts.  One  day,  \nIndra,   who   was   Arjuna's   father,   came   in \nthe   garb   of   a   brahmana   and   begged   of \nKarna  for  a  gift  of  the  divine  earrings  and  \narmor    with    which    he    had    been    born. \nKarna  took  them  out  and  gave  them  away  \naccordingly.    From    that    time,    Karna's \nstrength was reduced. \n\"Karna's   pledge   to   his   mother   Kunti   that \nhe   would   not   kill   more   than   one   of   the \nfive  of  you,  Parasurarna's  curse,  the  anger  \nof  the  brahmana  whose  cow  was  killed  by  \nKarna,   the   way   in   which   his   charioteer \nSalya   depressed   him   by   underrating   his \nvalor   and   Vasudeva's   stratagems,   these \ncombined  to  bring  about  Karna's  end.  Do  \nnot  grieve  believing  that  you  alone  caused \nhis     death.\"     Thus     said     Narada,     but \nYudhishthira   was   not   consoled   by   these \nwords.  \n\"Do  not  blame  yourself,  son,  for  Karna's, \ndeath,\"   said   Kunti.   \"His   father,   the   sun \n\nlord     himself,     pleaded     with     him.     He \nbegged   of   him   to   give   up   the   wicked-\nhearted   Duryodhana   and   join   you.   I   too \ntried  hard.  But  he  would  not  listen  to  us. \nHe brought his end on himself.\"  \n\"You      deceived      us,      mother\"      said \nYudhishthira,   \"by   hiding   the   secret   of   his \nbirth  from  us.  You  became  thus  the  cause  \nof   this   great   sin.   May   women   never   be \nable to keep a secret henceforth.\" \nThis     is     the     poet's     story     of     how \nYudhishthira    cursed    all    women    in    his \nanguish   over   having   killed   his   own   elder \nbrother.    It    is    a    common    notion    that \nwomen    cannot    keep    secrets.   And   this \nstory   is   a   beautiful   conception   illustrating \nthat popular belief.  \nIt  may  be  that  in  worldly  affairs,  it  is  an \nadvantage  to  be  able  to  keep  secrets.  But  it  \nis  not  great  virtue  from  the  point  of  view \nof  moral  character,  and  women  need  not \ngrieve over   an   incapacity   of   this   kind,   if \nindeed Kunti's legacy still persists.  \nThe   affectionate   temperament   natural   to \nwomen    may    perhaps    incline    them    to \nopenness.    But    some    women    do    keep \nsecrets  very  well  indeed,  and  not  a  man \npossess  this  ability  either.  It  is  a  fallacy  to  \nattribute   the   differences   that   arise   out   of \ntraining   and   occupation   on   nature   itself \nand  imagine  some  qualities  as  peculiar  to \na sex.  \n",

The   wisest   of   men   are \nsometimes   affected   by   envy   and   suffer \nthereby.   Brihaspati,   teacher   to   the   gods \nthemselves,  was  master  of  all  knowledge. \nHe  was  learned  in  all  the  Vedas  and  all  the  \nsciences,   yet   he   was   once   the   victim   of \nthis     debasing     emotion     and     suffered \ndisgrace.  \nBrihaspati      had      a      younger      brother, \nSamvarta,  who  was  also  a  person  of  great  \nlearning  and  a  very  good  man.  Brihaspati \nwas,  for  this  reason,  stricken  with  envy  of \nhis brother.  \nIn   this   world   men   become   envious   of \nothers,  just  because  the  others  are  good, \nwhile   they   themselves   are   not   so   good, \nand   they   cannot   bear   this.   It   is   strange \nindeed   that   men   should   not   suffer   even \nvirtue in others.  \nBrihaspati    harassed    Samvarta    in    many \nways.   When   he   could   not   stand   it   any \nmore,     poor     Samvarta     put     on     the \nappearance  of  an  eccentric  and  wandered \nfrom  place  to  place,  and  spent  his  days  in \nthat   way   to   escape   from   his   brother's \npersecution.  \nKing   Marutta   of   the   Ikshwaku   dynasty \nmade  great  penance  and  obtained  from  the  \nLord   of   Kailasa   a   great   goldmine   in   the \nHimalayas   and,   with   his   resources   thus \naugmented,  he  decided  to  perform  a  great  \nYajna.  \nMarutta   requested   Brihaspati   to   conduct \nthe   yajna   for   him.   But   Brihaspati   feared \nthat   Marutta   would,   as   a   result   of   the \nyajna,  overshadow  the  gods  who  were  his  \ncharge.  \nHe   refused   to   comply   with   the   king's \ninvitation,   despite   his   pressing   entreaties. \nThereupon,  king  Marutta,  who  had  come \nto    know    about    Samvarta    found    his \nwhereabouts  and  approached  him with  the  \ninvitation to conduct his yajna.  \nHe  at  first  refused  and  tried  to  avoid  the \nhonor,    but    finally    yielded.    This    further \nincreased      Brihaspati's      envy      of      his \nunfortunate brother. \n\"Here   is   this   enemy   of   mine,   Samvarta, \ngoing    to    conduct    king    Marutta's    great \nyajna.   What   shall   I   do   now?\"   Thus   did \nBrihaspati   brood   over   it   until   his   envy \naffected   his   health.   His   health   declined \nrapidly  and  he  became  thin  and  pale.  His \ncondition   grew   worse   everyday,   until   it \nattracted the attention of Indra himself.  \nIndra,   chief  of  the  gods,  approached  the \ndivine   preceptor   and   saluting   him   asked: \n\n\"Lord,  why  are  you  ill?  What  has  caused \nthis   languishing?   Do   you   sleep   well?   Do \nthe   attendants   serve   you   properly?   Do \nthey   anticipate   your   wishes   and   not   wait \nto     be     told?     Do     the     gods behave \ncourteously  towards  you  or  has  there  been  \nany lapse in this respect?\" \nTo    Indra's    anxious    inquiry,    Brihaspati \nreplied:  \"Deva  raja,  I  sleep  on  a  good  bed  \nand  in  right  time.  The  attendants  serve  me  \nwith     all     devotion.     There     is     nothing \nwanting    in    the    respect    and    courtesies \nshown  by  the  gods.\"  Then  his  voice  failed  \nand  he  could  not  proceed.  So  great  was  his  \nprostration of spirit. \n\"Why    are    you    grieved?\"    asked    Indra \naffectionately.   \"Why   have   you   grown   thin \nand  bloodless?  Tell  me  what  troubles  your  \nmind.\" \nBrihaspati   then   told   Indra   about   it   all. \n\"Samvarta   is   going   to   conduct   a   great \nyajna.  It  is  this  that  has  made  me  wan  and  \nthin.  I  cannot  help  it,\"  said  he.  Indra  was \nsurprised. \n\"Learned  brahmana,  there  is  no  object  of \ndesire  that  is  not  already  yours.  You  are \nwise  and  learned,  and  the  gods  themselves  \nhave  accepted  you  as  their  priest  and  wise  \ncounselor.  What  harm  can  Samvarta  do  to  \nyou?   There   is   nothing   you   can   lose   on \naccount   of   him.   Why   do   you   needlessly \ntake  upon  yourself  this  suffering  by  mere \nenvy?\"  \nIt   was   amusing   that   Indra   should   so   far \nand  so  humanly  forget  his  own  history  as \nto   give   counsel   of   good   conduct.   But \nBrihaspati   refreshed   his   memory   on   the \npoint    and    asked:    \"Would    you    yourself \ndelightedly    watch    your    enemy's    power \ngrowing?   Judge   me   by   how   you would \nhave  felt  had  you  been  in  my  position.  I \nbeg    of    you    to    save    me    against    this \nSamvarta.  You  must  find  a  way  to  put  this  \nman down.\"  \nIndra  sent  for  Agni  and  said  to  him:  \"Go \nand stop the yajna of Marutta somehow.\"  \nThe  god  of  fire  agreed  and  went  on  this \nmission.  The  trees  and  the  creepers  along \nhis  path  caught  fire  and  the  earth  trembled  \nas he marched roaring. \nHe   presented   himself   before   the   king   in \nhis divine form.  \nThe  king  was  mightily  pleased  to  see  Agni \nstand     before     him.     He     ordered     the \nattendants   to   do   all   the   usual   honors   of \nhospitality.  \"Let  him  be  duly  seated.  Have \nhis  feet  laved  and  bring  the  gifts  proper  to  \nhis  greatness,\"  said  the  king,  and  this  was  \ndone. \nAgni   then   explained   why   he   had   come. \n\"Do  give  up  this  Samvarta.  If  you  require \na  priest,  I  shall  bring  Brihaspati  himself  to  \nhelp you.\" \nSamvarta,   who   heard   this,   was   indignant. \nThe  wrath  of  one  who  led  the  strict  life  of  \na brahmacharin was exceedingly potent. \n\"Stop  this  chatter!\"  he  said  to  Agni.  \"Do \nnot let my anger burn you up.\" \nFire     reduces     things     to     ashes,     but \nbrahmacharya can burn up fire itself! \nAt   Samvarta's   anger   Agni,   trembling   like \nan  aspen  leaf,  retired  quickly.  He  returned  \nto Indra and told him what had happened.  \nThe  king  of  the  gods  could  not  believe  the  \nstory.  \"Agni,  you  burn  up other  things  in \nthe   world.   How   can   anything   burn   you? \nWhat   is   this   story   of   Samvarta’s   angry \neyes reducing you to ashes?\"' \n\"Not   so,   king   of   the   gods,\"   said   Agni. \n\"Brahmic  power  and  the  potency  born  of \nbrahmacharya   are   not   unknown   to   you.\" \nAgni   thus   reminded   Indra   of   what   the \nlatter  had  suffered;  incurring  the  wrath  of \nthose whom had attained Brahmic power. \nIndra    did    not    wrangle    but    called    a \nGandharva    had    said:    \"Now,    Agni    has \nfailed.  I  want  you  to  go  as  my  messenger  \nand  ask  Marutta  to  give  up  Samvarta.  Tell  \nhim  that  if  he  does  not,  he  will  incur  my \nwrath and be destroyed.\"  \n\nThe   Gandharva   went   accordingly   to   king \nMarutta    and    faithfully    conveyed    Indra's \nmessage and warning. \nThe   king   would   not   listen.   \"I   cannot   be \nguilty   of   the   deadly   sin   of   deserting   a \ntrusting   friend,\"   said   the   king:   \"I   cannot \ngive up Samvarta.\" \nThe   Gandharva   said:   \"O   king,   how   can \nyou  survive,  when  Indra  hurls  his  bolt  at \nyou?\"  \nEven   as   he   said   this,   the   clouds   above \nthundered  and  everyone  knew  that  the  god  \nof    the    thunderbolt    was    coming,    and \ntrembled in fear.  \nThe  king  was  in  great  fear  and  entreated \nSamvarta to save him. \n\"Fear  not,\"  said  Samvarta  to  the  king,  and  \nhe   proceeded   to   put   the   power   of   his \npenance into action.  \nIndra,   who   had   come   to   do   battle,   was \ncompelled   to   change   over   to   benevolent \npeace  and  to  take  part  in  the  yajna  as  the  \nradiant  god  of  sacrifices.  He  received  the \nburnt  offering  in  proper  form  and  retired. \nBrihaspati's   plan   of   envy   failed   miserably. \nBrahmacharya     triumphed.     Envy     is     a \ndeadly   sin.   It   is   a   universal   disease.   If \nBrihaspati   who   could   defeat   the   goddess \nof  knowledge  herself  in  learning  became  a  \nvictim  to  envy,  what  is  there  to  say  about  \nordinary mortals? \n",

You  have  \nindeed    failed    in    your    duty.    You    have \nsurely   practised   deceit   and   led   them   to \ndestruction.   Prepare   now   to   receive   my \ncurse!\"  Vasudeva  smiled  and  said:  \"Peace,  \npeace! Calm  yourself.  Do  not  use  up  the \nfruit  of  your  great  penances  in  this  anger. \nListen  to  what  I  say  and  then,  if  you  like,  \nyou may pronounce your curse.\" \nKrishna   pacified   the   indignant   brahmana \nand  appeared  to  him  in  his  all-embracing \nform, the Viswarupa. \n\"I  am  born  in  various  bodies  from  time  to  \ntime  to  save  the  world  and  establish  the \ngood.  In  whatever  body  I  am  born,  I  must  \nact   in   conformity   with   the   nature   of   that \nbody.  When  I  am  born  as  a  Deva,  I  act  as  \na  Deva  does.  If  I  appear  as  a  Yaksha  or  as  \na  Rakshasa,  I  do  everything  like  a  Yaksha  \nor  a  Rakshasa.  If  I  am  born  as  a  human \nbeing,  or  as  a  beast,  I  do  what  is  natural  to  \nthat  birth  and  complete  my  task.  I  begged  \nvery  hard  of  the  ignorant  Kauravas.  They \nwere   arrogant   and   intoxicated   by   power \nand  paid  no  heed  to  my  advice.  I  tried  to  \nintimidate   them.   Therein   also   I   failed.   I \nwas  in  wrath  and  showed  them  even  my \n\nViswarupa.   Even   that   failed   to   have   an \neffect.    They    persisted    in    wrongdoing. \nThey   waged   war   and   perished.   O   best \namong  brahmanas,  you  have  no  reason  to \nbe angry with me.\" \nAfter   this   explanation   of   Krishna,   Utanga \nrecovered      his      calm.      Krishna      was, \ndelighted.  \n\"I  wish  to  give  a  boon  to  you.  What  would  \nyou like?\" said Krishna. \n\"Achchyuta,\"    said    Utanga,    \"is    it    not \nenough  I  have  seen  Thee  and  Thy  Form \nUniversal?   I   do   not   desire   any   further \nboon.\" \nBut    Krishna    insisted    and    the    desert \nwandering   simple   brahmana   said:   \"Well, \nmy  Lord,  if  you  must  give  me  some  boon,  \nlet   me   find   water   to   drink   whenever   I \nmight feel thirsty. Give me this boon.\" \nKrishna  smiled.  \"Is  this  all?  Have  it  then,\" \nhe said, and proceeded on his journey.  \nOne   day   Utanga   was   very   thirsty   and, \nunable    to    find    water    anywhere    in    the \ndesert,   he   bethought   himself   of   the   boon \nhe had received. \nAs  soon  as  be  did  this,  a  Nishada  appeared  \nbefore  him,  clothed in  filthy  rags.  He  had  \nfive  hunting  hounds  in  leash  and  a  water-\nskin strapped to his shoulder.  \nThe    Nishada    grinned    at    Utanga    and \nsaying,  \"You  seem  to  be  thirsty.  Here  is \nwater  for  you,\"  offered  the  bamboo  spout  \nof  his  water-skin  to  the  brahmana  to  drink  \nfrom.  \nUtanga,  looking  at  the  man  and  his  dogs \nand    his    water    skin,    said    in    disgust: \n\"Friend,   I   do   not   need   it,   thank   you.\" \nSaying   this,   he   thought   of   Krishna   and \nreproached  him  in  his  mind:  \"Indeed,  was \nthis all the boon you gave me?\"  \nThe  outcaste  Nishada  pressed  Utanga  over  \nand  over  again  to  quench  his  thirst,  but  it  \nonly  made  Utanga  more  and  more  angry \nand  he  refused  to  drink.  The  hunter  and \nhis dogs disappeared. \nSeeing   the   strange   disappearance   of   the \nNishada,    Utanga    reflected:    \"Who    was \nthis?   He   could   not   have   been   a   real \nNishada.  It  was  certainly  a  test  and  I  have  \nblundered      miserably.      My      philosophy \ndeserted  me.  I  rejected  the  water  offered \nby  the  Nishada  and  proved  myself  to  be \nan arrogant fool.\"  \nUtanga   was   in   great   anguish.   A   moment \nlater    Madhava    himself    appeared    with \nconch    and    discus.    \"O    Purushottama!\" \nexclaimed    Utanga;    \"you    put    me    to    a \ndifficult  trial.  Was  it  right  of  you  to  try  me  \nthus?   Make   an   untouchable   offer   unclean \nwater  to  me,  a  brahmana,  to  drink.  Was \nthis  kind?\"  asked  Utanga.  Utanga  spoke  in \nbitter tones.  \nJanardana   smiled.   \"O   Utanga,   for   your \nsake,  when  you  put  my  boon  into  action,  I  \nasked  Indra  to  take  amrita  to  you  and  give  \nit  to  you  as  water.  He  said  he  could  not \ngive   to   a   mortal   what   would   give   him \nimmortality,   while   he   was   willing   to   do \nanything   else.   But   I   prevailed   upon   him \nand  he  agreed  to  take  amrita  and  give  it  to  \nyou  as  water,  provided  I  let  him  do  it  as  a  \nChandala   and   tested   your   understanding \nand  found  you  willing  to  take  water  from \na    Chandala.    I    accepted    the    challenge \nbelieving    you    had    attained    jnana    and \ntranscended  externals.  But  you  have  done \nthis  and  made  me  suffer  defeat  at  Indra's \nhands.\"  Utanga  saw  his  mistake  and  was \nashamed. \n",

      "content": "\nWHEN   Yudhishthira   was   crowned   and \ninstalled    as    king    after    the    Kurukshetra \nbattle,  he  performed  an  aswamedha  yajna.  \nAs  was  the  custom  on  occasions  of  this \ngreat  horse  sacrifice,  all  the  princes  of  the  \nland   gathered   on   invitation   and   the   yajna \nwas    completed    in    great    splendor.    The \nbrahmanas  and  the  poor  and  the  destitute \npeople,   who   had  come  in  great  numbers \nfrom   all   parts   of   the   country,   received \nbounteous   gifts.   Everything   was   done   in \n\nmagnificent   style   and   in   conformity   With \nthe injunctions relating to the sacrifice. \nFrom     somewhere     unseen,     a     weasel \nsuddenly   appeared   right   in   the   middle  of \nthe   assembled   guests   and   priests   in   the \ngreat   pavilion   and,   after   rolling   on   the \nground  laughed  a  loud  human  laugh  as  if \nin   derision.   The   priests   were   alarmed   at \nthis  strange  and  unnatural  occurrence  and \nwondered  whether  it  was  some  evil  spirit \nthat had  come  to  pollute  and  disturb  the \nsacred rites. \nThe   weasel's   body   was   on   one   side   all \nshining    gold.    This    remarkable    creature \nturned  round  and  took  a  good  view  of  the  \nassembly      of      princes      and      learned \nbrahmanas   that   had   come   from   various \ncountries    and    gathered    in    that    great \npavilion and began to speak: \n\"Princes   assembled   and   priests,   listen   to \nme.  You  no  doubt  believe  that  you  have \ncompleted   your   yajna   in   splendid   style. \nOnce  upon  a  time,  a  poor  brahmana  who  \nlived   in   Kurukshetra   made   a   gift   of   a \npound   of   maize   flour.   Your   great   horse \nsacrifice   and   all   the   gifts   made   in   that \nconnection  are  less  than  that  small  gift  of \nthe   Kurukshetra   brahmana.   You   seem   to \nthink  too  much  of  your  yajna.  Pray,  be  not  \nso vain about it.\" \nThe  gathering  was  amazed  at  this  strange \nand    impertinent    speech    of    the    golden \nweasel.   The   brahmana   priests,   who   had \nperformed  the  sacrificial  rites,  went  up  to \nthe weasel and spoke to it: \n\"Wherefrom   and   why   have   you   come   to \nthis  yajna,  performed  by  good  and  worthy \nmen?   Who   are   you?   Why   do   you   utter \nwords  of  scorn  about  our  sacrifice?  This \naswamedha   has   been   duly   completed   in \nevery   detail   in   accordance   with   sastraic \ninjunctions.    It    is    not    proper    that    you \nshould    speak    derisively    of    our    great \nsacrifice.   Everyone   that   has   come   to   this \nyajna  has  been  duly  attended  to  and  has \nbeen   accorded   suitable   honors   and   gifts. \nEveryone   is   pleased   with   the   gifts   and \nreturns  happy  and  contented.  The  mantras \nhave    been    chanted    perfectly    and    the \noblations  duly  offered.  The  four  castes  are  \npleased.  Why  do  you  speak  as  you  do? Do \nexplain yourself.\" \nThe   weasel   laughed   again   and   said:   \"O \nbrahmanas,  what  I  said  is  true.  I  do  not \ngrudge     the     good     fortune     of     king \nYudhishthira  or  the  good  fortune  of  any  of \nyou.  It  is  not  envy  that  makes  me  say  this.  \nThe  yajna,  which  you  have  just  completed \nso  showily,  is  not  in  truth  as  great  an  act  \nas  that  gift  of  the  poor  brahmana,  which  I  \nhave  seen.  And  in  reward  for  his  gift,  he \nand    his    wife,    son    and    daughter-in-law \nwere  immediately  taken  to  swarga.  Listen \nto   my   story   which   is   a   true   narrative   of \nwhat    I    saw    myself.    Long    before    you \nwaged  your  battle  there,  a  brahmana,  lived  \nin   Kurukshetra,   who   obtained   his   daily \nfood  by  gleaning  in  the  fields.  He  and  his  \nwife,   son   and   daughter-in-law,   all   four \nlived    in    this    manner.    Everyday    in    the \nafternoon   they   would   sit   down   and   have \ntheir  only  meal  for  the  day.  On  days  when  \nthey    failed    to    find    enough    grain,    they \nwould   fast   until   the   next   afternoon.   They \nwould  not  keep  over  any  thing  for  the  next  \nday  if  they  got  more  than  they  required  for  \nthe   day.   This   was   the   strict   unchhavritti \ndiscipline  they  had  pledged  themselves  to \nobserve.  They  passed  their  days  thus  for \nmany   years,   when   a   great   drought   came \nand  there  was  famine  all  over  the  land.  All  \ncultivation   ceased   and   there   was   neither \nsowing    nor    harvesting    nor    any    grain \nscattered  in  the  fields  to  be  gleaned.  For \nmany   days   the   brahmana   and   his   family \nstarved.    One    day,    after    wandering    in \nhunger  and  heat,  with  great  difficulty  they \ncame    home    with    a    small    quantity    of \nmaize,    which    they    had    gathered.    They \nground   it   and   after   saying   their   prayers \nthey  divided  the  flour  into  four  equal  parts  \nand,   offering   thanks   to   God,   sat   down \n\neagerly   to   eat.   Just   then,   a   brahmana \nentered   and   he   was   exceedingly   hungry. \nSeeing   an   unexpected   guest   arrive,   they \ngot  up  and  made  due  obeisance  and asked \nhim     to     join     them.     The     pure-souled \nbrahmana    and    his    wife    and    son    and \ndaughter-in-law          were          exceedingly \ndelighted   to   have   the   good   fortune   of \nreceiving   guest   at   that   juncture.   'Oh   best \nof  brahmanas,  I  am  a  poor  man.  This  flour  \nof  maize  was  obtained  in accordance  with  \ndharma.   Pray   accept   this.   May   blessings \nattend   on   you,'   said   the   brahmana   of \nKurukshetra   and   gave   his   share   of   the \nflour   to   the   guest.   The   guest   ate   it   with \navidity   but   he   was   still   hungry   when   he \nhad    finished.    Seeing    his    hungry    and \nunsatisfied     look,     the     brahmana     was \ngrieved   and   did   not   know   what   to   do, \nwhen  his  wife  said:  'Lord,  give  my  share \nalso  to  him.  I  shall  be  glad  if  the  guest's \nhunger    he    satisfied.'    Saying    this,    she \nhanded   her   share   of   the   flour   to   her \nhusband  to  be  given  to  the  guest.  'Faithful  \none,'   said   the   brahmana,   'the   beasts   and \nthe   birds   and   all   the   animals   tend   the \nfemales   of   their   species   with   care.   May \nman   do   worse?   I   cannot   accept   your \nsuggestion.  What  shall  I  gain  in  this  or  in \nthe  other  world  if  I  leave  you  to  starve  and \nsuffer  hunger,  you  who  help  me  and  serve  \nme    to    do    the    sacred    duties    of    a \nhouseholder's   life?   Beloved   one,   you   are \nnow   skin   and   bone   and   famished   and \nexceedingly  hungry.  How  can  I  leave  you \nto   suffer   in   that   condition   and   hope   to \nattain  any  good  by  feeding  the  guest?  No,  \nI   cannot   accept   your   offer.'   'You   are \nversed  in  the  sastras,  best  of  brahmanas', \nreplied  the  wife.  'Is  it  not  true  that  dharma,  \nartha  and  all  the  objects  of  human  activity \nare   to   the   common   and   equal   benefit   of \nboth  of  us  who  have  been  joined  together?  \nDo  look  on  me  with  compassion  and  take  \nmy   share   of   the   flour   and   satisfy   the \nrequirements   of   this   our   guest.   You   are \nhungry  as  I  am  and  you  should  not  make  \nany   distinction   between   us.   I   entreat   you \nnot   to   deny   my   request.'   The   brahmana \nyielded  and  took  the  wife's  share  and  gave  \nit  to  the  guest  who  took  it  greedily  and  ate  \nit.  But  he  was  still  hungry!  Great  was  the  \ndistress     of     the     poor     brahmana     of \nKurukshetra.  His  son,  who  saw  this,  came  \nforward.   'Father,   here   is   my   share,'   said \nhe.  'Give  it  to  this  guest  who  seems  to  be  \nstill  hungry.  I  shall  be  indeed  happy  if  we  \nshall  thus  be  able  to  fulfil  our  duty.'  The \nfather's    distress    increased.    'Child!'    he \nexclaimed,   'old   men   can   stand   starvation. \nYouth's  hunger  is  severe.  I  am  not  able  to  \nfind  it  in  my  heart  to  accept  what  you  say.'  \nThe  son  insisted:  'it  is  the  duty  of  the  son \nto   look   after   his   father   in   his   declining \nyears.   The   son   is   not   different   from   the \nfather.  Is  it  not  said  that  the  father  is  born \nafresh  in  his  son?  My  share  of  the  flour  is  \nyours in  truth.  I  beg  of  you  to  accept  what  \nI  give  and  feed  this  hungry  guest.'  'Dear \nboy,  your  nobility  and  your  mastery  over \nthe  senses  fill  me  with  pride.  Blessing  on \nyou.   I   shall   accept   your   share!'   said   the \nfather,   and   he   took   the   son's   flour   and \ngave  it  to  the  guest  to  eat.  The  guest  ate  \nthe  third  part  of  the  flour  also  but  he  was  \nstill  hungry!  The  brahmana,  who  lived  on \nscattered   grain,   was   confused.   While   he \nwas  in  distress,  not  knowing  that  to  do,  his  \ndaughter-in-law      addressed      him      thus: \n'Lord,  I  shall  give  my  share  too  and  gladly  \ncomplete  our  efforts  to  feed  this  guest.  I \nbeg  of  you  to  accept  it  and  bless  me,  your  \nchild,   for,   by   that,   I   shall   have   eternal \ngood   as   my   reward.'   The   father-in-law \nwas    sad    beyond    measure.    'O    girl    of \nspotless  character,  pale  and  emaciated  as \nyou   are   from   starvation,   you   propose   to \ngive  your  part  of  the  food  also  to  me,  so  \nthat  I  may  earn  merit  by  giving  it  to  this \nguest.  If  I  accept  your  offer,  I  shall  indeed  \nbe  guilty  of  cruelty.  How  could  I  possibly \nlook  on  when  you  wither  in  hunger?'  The  \n\ngirl  would  not  listen.  'Father,  you  are  lord  \nof  my  lord  and  master,  preceptor  of  my \npreceptor,  god  of  my  god.  I  implore  you \nto   accept   my   flour.   Is   not   this   body   of \nmine  dedicated  wholly  to  serve  my  lord? \nYou  should  help  me  to  attain  the  good.  Do \ntake    this    flour,    I    entreat    you.'    Thus \nimplored     by     his     daughter-in-law,     the \nbrahmana  accepted  her  share  of  the  flour \nand   blessed   her   saying:   'Loyal   girl,   may \nevery  good  be  yours!'  The  guest  received \nthis  last  portion  avidly  and  ate  it  and  was  \nsatisfied.     'Blessed     is     your     hospitality, \ngiven   with   the   purest   intent   and   to   the \nuttermost  of  your  capacity.  Your  gift  has \nleased    me.    Lo    there,    the    gods    are \nshowering   flowers   in   admiration   of   your \nextraordinary   sacrifice.   See   the   gods   and \nthe  Gandharvas  have  come  down  in  their \nbright    chariots    with    their    attendants    to \ntake   you   with   your   family   to   the   happy \nregions    above.    Your    gift    has    achieved \nswarga   for   you,   as   well   as   for   your \nancestors.        Hunger        destroys        the \nunderstanding   of   men.   It   makes   them   go \naside  from  the  path  of  rectitude.  It  leads \nthem   to   evil   thoughts.   The   pious,   when \nsuffering   the   pangs   of   hunger,   lose   their \nsteadfastness.   But   you   have,   even   when \nhungry,  bravely  set  aside  your  attachment \nto  wife  and  son  and  placed  dharma  above  \nall    else.    Rajasuya    sacrifices    and   horse \nsacrifices   completed   in   splendor,   would \npale   into   insignificance   before   the   great \nsacrifice    you    have    done    through    this \nsingle   act   of   hospitality.   The   chariot   is \nwaiting  for  you.  Enter  and  go  to  swarga, \nyou    and    your    family.'    Saying    this    the \nmysterious guest disappeared.\" \nHaving      related      this      story      of      the \nKurukshetra     brahmana     who     lived     by \ngleaning  scattered  ears  of  corn  in  the  field,  \nthe weasel continued:  \n\"I   was   nearby   and   caught   the   fragrance \nwafted  from  that  flour  of  the  brahmana.  It  \nmade  my  head  all  gold.  I  then  went  and \nrolled  in  joy  on  the  ground  where  some  of  \nthe  flour  had  been  scattered.  It  made  one  \nside  of  me  into  bright  gold.  I  turned  on  the  \nother  side  but  there  was  no  more  flour  left  \nand   that   part   of   me   is   still   as   it   was. \nDesirous   of   getting my   body   made   all \ngold,  I  have  been  trying  every  place  where  \nmen  perform  great  yajnas  and  penances.  I  \nheard   that   Yudhishthira   of   world   fame \nwas   performing   a   yajna   and   came   here, \nbelieving  that  this  sacrifice  might  come  up \nto  the  standard.  But  I  found  it  did  not.  So,  \nI  said  that  your  great  aswamedha  was  not  \nso   great   as   the   loft   of   flour   which   that \nbrahmana  made  to  his  guest.\"  The  weasel \nthen disappeared. \n",

It  was  this  \nthat   Arjuna   pointed   out   in   his   powerful \nplea    before    Krishna    when    the    battle \ncommenced.  Krishna  in  answer,  explained \nthe   principles   of   man's   activities   and   the \nproper  discharge  of  one's  duties.

They   tried   to   make   him \nhappy.  They  did  nothing  to  make  him  feel \nhumiliated.   Yudhishthira   issued   no   orders \nexcept  with  his  approval.  Gandhari,  whose  \nhundred  sons  had  disappeared  like  dream-\ngold,  was  looked  after  by  Kuntidevi  with \nloving  and  sisterly  devotion  and  Draupadi \ndutifully    ministered    to    them    both,    with \nequal respect.  \nYudhishthira       furnished       Dhritarashtra's \nhouse    with    rich    seats    and    beds    and \ndecorations  and  all  else  that  was  wanted. \nHe    sent    from    the    royal    kitchen    most \ndainty   and   palatable   dishes   prepared   for \nhim.   Kripacharya,   lived   with   Dhritarashtra \nand  kept  him  company.  Vyasa  comforted \nhim    with    instructive    stories    of    olden \ntimes, calculated to assuage his sorrow.  \nIn    the    administration    of    affairs    of    the \nState,              Yudhishthira              consulted \nDhritarashtra  and  conducted  himself  so  as \nto   give   him   the   feeling   that   in   truth   the \nkingdom  was  ruled  on  his  behalf  and  that \nhe,   as   the   eldest   member of   the   family, \nwas still the supreme authority.  \nYudhishthira    was    most    careful    in    his \nspeech,   never   to   allow   himself   to   say \nanything  to  cause  pain  to  the  bereaved  old  \nman.     The     princes,     who     came     to \nHastinapura   from   all   parts   of   the   world, \ngave   Dhritarashtra   the   same   honors;   as \nthey   did   of   old,   as   if   he   were   still   the \nemperor.  \nThe   women   attendants   gave   Gandhari   no \noccasion     to     feel     her     fallen     estate. \nYudhishthira   had   instructed   his   brothers \nmost   strictly   that   nothing   should   be   done \nto   cause   the   slightest   pain  to  their  uncle, \nwho had lost all his sons.  \nThe   brothers,   with   perhaps   the   exception \nof      Bhima,      followed      this      injunction \nfaithfully.     Dhritarashtra     too     conducted \nhimself    lovingly    towards    the    Pandavas. \nHe  showed  no  ill  will  towards  them  even \nas   they   showed   him   no   unkindness.   The \nPandavas         behaved         unexceptionably \ntowards   their   old   uncle.   After   a   time, \nhowever,   Bhima   began   on   occasions   to \ngive     cause     for     offence.     He     would \nsometimes,    in    impatience,    countermand \nthe   old   man's   instructions.   He   would   let \nfall   in   Dhritarashtra's   hearing   words   like \n\"Those    perverse    cousins    of    ours    have \nthemselves to thank for their destruction.\"  \nIt  was  not  possible  for  Bhima  to  forget  or  \nforgive  Duryodhana,  Karna  or  Duhsasana. \nGandhari   felt   intensely   grieved   when   she \nnoticed   that   Bhima   uttered   words,   which \npained  Dhritarashtra.  She  was,  however,  a  \nnoble  and  enlightened  soul.  Whenever  she \nfelt  pained  at  what  Bhima  said,  she  would  \nlook  at  Kunti  and  find  peace.  For  Kunti \nwas   a   veritable   embodiment   of   dharma \nand    inspired    forbearance.    Fifteen years \npassed in this manner. \n",

You \nhave   tended   me   most   lovingly.   I   have \nmade  gifts  and  offerings  to  ancestors  and \nfulfilled   all   my   desires   in   that   respect. \nBereaved   Gandhari,   laying   aside  her  own \ngrief,  has  ministered  to  my  physical  wants \nall    these    years.    My    cruel    sons,    who \ncommitted       unforgivable       wrong       to \nDraupadi  and  deprived  you  of  your  lawful \n\ninheritance,   perished   on   account   of   their \nsins.   But   they   fought   like   brave   soldiers \nand  died  in  the  battlefield  and  have  gone \nto   the   happy   regions   reserved   for   the \nbrave.   The   time   has   come   when   with \nGandhari  I  must  do  what  has  to  be  done  \nfor   our   next   state.   You   know   what   the \nsastras  have  lain  down.  I  must  now  go  to  \nthe  forest.  These  robes  must  be  replaced  \nby  bark  and  tattered  old  clothes,  suitable \nfor  the  life  of  Vanaprastha.  I  desire  to  go  \nand   live   in   the   forest,   praying   for   your \ngood.  I  want  your  permission  for  this.  Let  \nme  follow  the  practice  of  our  fathers.  As \nking,   you   will   share   in   the   fruits   of   my \npenance.\" \nYudhishthira   received   a   shock   when   he \nsaw  Dhritarashtra  and  heard  him  say  this. \n\"I  did  not  know,\"  he  said,  \"that  you  had \nbeen   fasting   and   sleeping   on   the   bare \nground   and   mortifying   your   flesh   in   this \nmanner.  My  brothers  too  were  unaware  of \nthis.  I  was  misled  into  believing  you  were \nwell  looked  after  and  happy.  Father,  you \nhave  suffered  grief,  for  which  there  can  be  \nno  solace.  I  see  no  good  in  kingdom  or \npleasures.    I    am    a    sinner.    Desire    and \nambition   deceived   me   into   this.   Let   your \nson  Yuyutsu  be  king,  or  anyone  else  you \nchoose.  Or  if  you  will  do  so,  you  yourself \nmay  take  up  the  duties  of  king  and  look \nafter  the  people.  I  shall  go  to  the  forest. \nLet  me  terminate  this  chapter  of  error.  I \nimplore    you    to    save    me    from    further \nobloquy  and  burning shame.  I  am  not  the  \nking.  You  are  the  king.  You  ask  me  for \npermission  to  go.  How  then  can  I  give  or  \nrefuse   permission   to   you?   Let   me   assure \nyou  that  my  anger  against  Duryodhana  is \na  thing  of  the  past,  gone  without  a  trace. \nFate    willed    it    and    engulfed    us    all    in \nconfusion   of   mind.   And   events   happened \nwhich   were   not   in   our   control.   We   are \nyour   children,   even   like   Duryodhana   and \nhis   brothers.   Gandhari   and   Kunti   is   alike \nmother  to  me  and  command  equal  regard \nand  filial  affection  from  me,  their  child.  If \nyou  go  away  to  the  forest,  I  must  go  with  \nyou  and  serve  you  there.  If  you  retire  to \nthe  woods  and  leave  me  here,  what  joy \nshall  I  have  in  kingship?  I  prostrate  myself \nbefore  you  and  implore  you  to  forgive  the  \nerrors  we  have  been  guilty  of.  Serving  you  \nwill   give   me  true  joy  and  peace  of  mind. \nGive   me   that   opportunity   and   privilege. \nDo not desert me.\" \nDhritarashtra   was   deeply   moved.   But   he \nsaid:   \"Kunti's beloved   son,   my   mind   is \nfixed    on    going    to    the    forest    and    on \npenance.   I   can   find   no   peace   otherwise \nnow.   I   have   lived   under   your   roof   for \nmany  years.  You  and  all  your  people  have  \nserved   me   with   unstinted   devotion.   You \nmust  permit  me  now  to  fulfil  my  wish  and  \nlet me go.\" \nHaving  thus  spoken  to  Yudhishthira,  who \nstood   with   clasped   hands   and   trembling \nwith    agitation,    Dhritarashtra    turned    to \nVidura  and  Kripacharya:  \"I  beg  of  you  to  \ncomfort  the  king  and  make  him  grant  my \nprayer.  My  mind  is  fixed  on  the  forest.  I \nam  unable  to  speak  any  more.  I  am  feeling  \ndry  in  my  throat.  Perhaps,  it  is  due  to  age.  \nI   have   talked   too   much.   I   am   tired.\" \nSaying    this,    he    leaned    helplessly    on \nGandhari and swooned.  \nYudhishthira    was    unable    to    bear    this \ndistress   of   the   grand   old   man,   who   had \npossessed  the  sinews  of  an  elephant  and \nhad   had   strength   enough   to   crush   the \nmetal figure of Bhima into powder.  \nHow    lean    he    had    become    now    and \nemaciated,     with     his     bones     showing \nthrough      his      skin,      piteously      leaning \nsenseless on Gandhari like one destitute.  \n\"Have   I   caused   all   this?\"   he   reproached \nhimself.   \"Miserable   and   unworthy   am   I, \nignorant       of       dharma,       devoid       of \nintelligence. A curse on my learning!\"  \nHe  sprinkled  water  on  Dhritarashtra's  face  \nand   caressingly   stroked   him   with   his   soft \nhands.  \n\nWhen  the  old  man  recovered,  he  tenderly \nclasped   the   Pandava   to   his   bosom   and \nmuttered:   \"My   dear   boy,   how   sweet   is \nyour touch! I am happy.\"  \nThen    Vyasa    entered.    When    he    was \nacquainted   with   what   had   happened,   he \nsaid to Yudhishthira:  \n\"Do    what    Dhritarashtra,    eldest    of    the \nKurus,  desires.  Let  him  go  to  the  forest. \nHe  is  old.  All  his  sons  have  gone  before \nhim.    It    is    not    possible    for   him   much \nlonger  to  bear  his  grief.  Gandhari,  whom \nGod   has   blessed   with   enlightenment,   has \nborne  her  sorrows  with  courage.  Do  not \nstand  in  the  way  of  their  wishes.  Let  not \nDhritarashtra  pine  away  and  die  here.  Let \nhim   go   and   live   among   the   honeyladen \nflowers   of   the   forest   and   breathe   their \nfragrance,   leaving   the   cares   of   the   world \nbehind.  The  dharma  of  kings  is  to  die  in \nbattle    or    to    spend    their    last    days    in \nretirement   in   the   forest.   Dhritarashtra   has \nruled  the  kingdom  and  performed  yajnas. \nWhen   you   were   in   the   wilderness   for \nthirteen  years,  he  enjoyed  the  wide  earth \nthrough  his  son  and  gave  bounteous  gifts. \nYou   left   him   nothing   to   desire.   The   time \nhas  come  for  him  to  do  penance.  Let  him \ngo  with  your  hearty  consent,  and  without \nanger in his heart.\" \nDharmaraja said: \"So be it!\"  \nThen Vyasa returned to his hermitage. \n",

The  Vrishnis,  the  Bhopas  and  other \nbranches    of    the    Yadavas    belonging    to \nKrishna's     tribe     spent     their     days     in \nunrestrained    self-indulgence    and    luxury. \nThey    lost    all    sense    of    discipline    and \nhumility. \nOnce,  some  rishis  came  to  Dwaraka.  The  \narrogant   and   irreverent   Yadavas   mocked \nthese   rishis   with   a   practical   joke.   They \ndressed  up  one  of  their  young  men  like  a  \nwoman  and,  presenting  him  to  the  revered  \nguests,   said:   \"O   ye   learned   men,   tell   us \nwhether   this   lady   will   have   a   boy   or   a \ngirl.\" \nThe  rishis  saw  through  the  irreverent  joke \nand   said   in   anger:   \"This   person   will   give \nbirth  to  a  mace,  not  a  boy  or  a  girl  and  that  \nmace  will  prove  to  be  Yama  to  your  tribe  \nand  destroy  you  all.\"  The  rishis  departed \nafter pronouncing this curse. \nThe      foolish      Yadavas      were      rather \nperturbed    at    this    unpleasant    ending    of \nwhat they had thought was a good joke.  \nNext   day,   they   were   in   consternation   to \nsee  that  Samba,  the  man  who  had  been \ndressed   up   in   female   clothes,   developed \nlabor  pains  and  lo  and  behold,  gave  birth \nto   a   mace!   This   filled   them   with   terror \nbecause  they  felt that  their  end  was  near \nas the rishis had cursed. \nThey   deliberated   long   and   finally   ground \nthe   mace   to   fine   powder,   which   they \nscattered  in  the  sea,  and  thought  they,  had  \nthus disposed of the danger.  \nNothing  happened  for  some  time.  Seasons  \npassed.  The  rains  came  and  on  the  beach,  \nnear  where  they  had  strewn  the  fine  dust \nof  the  awful  club,  there  sprang  up  a  dense,  \ncrop of rushes.  \nWhen   the   Yadavas   saw   this,   they   were \ncurious     and     amused,     for     they     had \nforgotten  all  about  the  curse  of  the  revered  \nguests. \nOne  day,  long  after,  the  Yadavas  went  to  \nthe  beach  for  a  picnic  and  spent  the  whole  \nday  in  dance  and  drink  and  revelry.  The \nliquor began to work.  \nAt    first    merry,    then    pugnacious,    they \nbegan   to   talk   without   restrain,   raking   up \nold    offences    and    quarrelling,    on    slight \ncause    with    one    another.    Among    the \nYadavas,   Kritavarma   had   fought   on   the \nside  of  the  Kauravas  and  Satyaki  on  that \nof the Pandavas.  \n\"Would    any    Kshatriya    attack    and    kill \nsleeping    soldiers,    O    Kritavarma?    You \nhave  brought  a  great  and  lasting  disgrace \non our    tribe,\"    said    Satyaki,    taunting \nKritavarma,   and   a   number   of   drunken \nYadavas  applauded  the  attack.  Kritavarma  \ncould not bear the insult.  \n\n\"Like  a  butcher,  you  slaughtered  the  great  \nBhurisravas  when  seated  in  yoga  after  his \nright  hand  was  cut  off  and  you,  coward, \ndare   to   taunt   me,\"   he   exclaimed   and   a \nnumber   of   the   revelers   joined   him   and \nbegan  to  scoff  at  Satyaki  for  his  barbarous  \ndeed. \nSoon,  all  the  Yadavas  were  in  the  quarrel \non   one   side   or   the   other   and   presently \nfrom   words   they   came   to   blows,   which \nswiftly developed into a free fight.  \nSatyaki,   with   his   sword   drawn,   sprang \nupon   Kritavarma   and   cut   his   head   off, \nexclaiming:    \"Here    is    the    end    of    the \ncoward who killed sleeping soldiers! \" \nOthers  immediately  fell  upon  Satyaki  with \ntheir     drinking     bowls     and     pots     and \nanything they could lay hands upon.  \nPradyumna,  Krishna's  son,  joined  the  fray \nto    rescue    Satyaki    and    there    was    a \ndesperate   melee   in   which   both   Satyaki \nand Pradyumna were killed.  \nKrishna  knew  that  the  destined  hour  was \ncome,  and  plucking  the  tall  rushes,  which \nfringed   the   beach,   laid   about   him   with \nthem indiscriminately.  \nThis   led   to   every   one   of   the   Yadavas \ndoing    the    same    and    there    was    great \nindiscriminate   slaughter.   The   rishis'   curse \nhad begun to work. \nThe  rushes  that  had  grown  out  of  the  mace  \nbecame  each  one  of  them  a  mace  as  it  was  \nplucked    by    the    doomed    men    in    their \nunreasonable  fury.  They  used  them  on  one  \nanother  with  deadly  effect  and  soon  all  of \nthem    were    destroyed    in    this    drunken \nbrawl. \nBalarama,   who   was   seeing   all   this,   was \noverwhelmed  with  shame  and  disgust  and \nsank  to  the  ground.  He  gave  up  his  life  as  \nhe  lay  in  a  yoga  trance.  Balarama  passed \naway  into  the  ocean  in  a  stream  of  light, \nwhich   issued   from   his   forehead   like   a \nsilver   serpent.   Thus   ended   the   avatar   of \nNarayana in Balarama.  \nKrishna saw   all   his   people   thus   destroy \nthemselves   as   predestined.   When   he   saw \nthe  passing  of  Balarama,  he  roamed  about  \nin    deep    meditation    in    the    wilderness, \npondering  on  the  completion  of  his  avatar.  \n\"The  time  has  come  for  me  to  go,\"  he  said  \nto   himself   and,   lying   on   the   ground   fell \nasleep.  \nIn  that  wooded  beach,  a  hunter,  prowling \nfor   game,   saw   Vasudeva   lying   on   the \nground     among     the     shrubs.     From     a \ndistance,  the  hunter  mistook  Krishna  for  a  \nwild animal resting on the ground. \nHe  bent  his  bow  and  shot  an  arrow  at  the \nprostrate  figure  which,  piercing  his  foot  in \nthe   insteep,   went   full   through   his   body. \nThus  did  the  great  Vasudeva  depart  from \nthe world of men. \n",

When    the    Pandavas \nreceived  the  news,  they  lost  all  remaining \nattachment to life on earth.  \nThey          crowned          Parikshit,          son \nofAbhimanyu,   as   emperor   and   the   five \nbrothers  left  the  city  with  Draupadi.  They \nwent   out   on   a   pilgrimage,   visiting   holy \nplaces and finally reached the Himalayas.  \nA  dog  joined  them  somewhere  and  kept \nthem  company  all  along.  And  the  seven  of \nthem   climbed   the   mountain   on   their   last \npilgrimage.     As     they     toiled     up     the \nmountain   path   one   by   one   fell   exhausted \nand died.  \nThe   youngest   succumbed   first.   Draupadi, \nSahadeva  and  Nakula  were  released  from \nthe  burden  of  the  flesh  one  after  another. \nThen    followed    Arjuna    and    then    great \nBhima too.  \nYudhishthira   saw   his   dear   ones   fall   and \ndie.   Yet,   serenely   he   went   on   not   giving \nway  to  grief,  for  the  light  of  Truth  burned  \nbright    before    him.    Yudhishthira    knew \n\nwhat     was     shadow     and     what     was \nsubstance.  \nThe   dog   still   followed   Yudhishthira.   The \nlesson  enforced  by  the  poet  in  this  episode  \nof   the   dog   is   that   dharma   is   the   only \nconstant companion in life's journey.  \nIt  was  dharma  who,  in  the  shape  of  the \ndog,      followed      Yudhishthira      up      the \nwearisome     mountain     path,     when     his \nbrothers   and   wife   had   gone   leaving   him \nalone. \nFinally,   when   he   reached   a   great   height, \nIndra appeared in his chariot. \n\"Your  brothers  and  Draupadi  have  arrived  \nbefore    you.    You    have    lagged    behind, \nburdened   with   your   body.   Ascend   my \nchariot  and  go  with  me  in  the  flesh.  I  have  \ncome  to  take  you,\"  said  Indra.  But  when \nYudhishthira   went   up   to   take   his   seat   in \nIndra's chariot, the dog also climbed up.  \n\"No,  no,\"  said  Indra.  \"There  is  no  place \nfor  dogs  in  swarga,\"  and  pushed  the  dog \naway.  \n\"Then   there   is   no   room   for   me   either,\" \nsaid  Yudhishthira,  and  refused  to  enter  the  \nheavenly   chariot   if   he   had   to   leave   his \nfaithful companion behind.  \nDharma   had   come   to   test   Yudhishthira's \nloyalty  and  he  was  pleased  with  his  son's \nconduct.   The   dog   vanished   from   sight. \nYudhishthira   reached   swarga.   There,   he \nsaw Duryodhana.  \nThe  Kuru  prince  was  seated  on  a  beautiful  \nthrone  and  he  shone  with  the  splendor  of \nthe     sun and     around     him     stood     in \nattendance   the   goddess   of   heroism   and \nother  angels.  He  did  not  see  his  brothers \nor      anyone      else.      Yudhishthira      was \nastonished.  \n\"Where   are   my   brothers,   ye   denizens   of \nswarga?\"   asked   Yudhishthira.   \"This   man \nof   greed,   of   limited   vision,  is  here.  I  do \nnot  care  to  spend  my  time  in  his  company.  \nWe  were  driven  by  this  man's  envy  and \nspite   to   kill   friends   and   relatives.   We \nstood   tied   by   dharma   to   inaction   when, \nbefore  our  eyes,  innocent  Panchali,  united \nto  us  in  sacred  wedlock,  was  dragged  to \nthe   Hall   of   the   Assembly   and   insulted \nunder   the   orders   of   this   wicked   man.   I \ncannot  bear  the  sight  of  this  man.  Tell  me,  \nwhere   are   my   brothers?   I   wish   to   go \nwhere   they   are.\"   Saying   this   Yudhishthira \naverted  his  eyes  from  where  Duryodhana \nwas seated in glory.  \nThen     Narada,     the     heavenly     rishi     of \nencyclopedic           knowledge,           smiled \ndisapprovingly   at   Yudhishthira   and   said: \n\"Renowned   prince,   this   is   not   right.   In \nswarga,   we   harbor   no   ill   will.   Do   not \nspeak   in   this   manner   about   Duryodhana. \nThe   brave   Duryodhana   has   attained   his \npresent  state  by  force  of  kshatriya  dharma.  \nIt  is  not  right  to  let  the  things  of  the  flesh \nstay   in   the   mind   and   breed   ill   will.   Do \nfollow   the   law   and   stay   here   with   king \nDuryodhana.  There  is  no  place  in  swarga \nfor   hatred.   You   have   arrived   here   with \nyour  human  body;  so  it  is  that  you  have \nthese      inappropriate      feelings.      Discard \nthem, son!\"  \nYudhishthira replied:  \n\"O  sage,  Duryodhana,  who  did  not  know \nright  from  wrong,  who  was  a  sinner,  who  \ncaused   suffering   to   good   men,   who   fed \nenmity  and  anger  and  who  brought  death \nto  countless  men,  has  attained  this  swarga  \nof    warriors.    Where    is    that    region    of \ngreater  glory,  which  must  be  the  abode  of \nmy     brave     and     good     brothers     and \nDraupadi?   I   am   eager   to   see   them   and \nKarna,  and  also  all  the  friends  and  princes  \nwho  gave  up  their  lives  in  battle  for  me.  I  \ndo   not   see   them   here.   I   desire   to   meet \nagain   Virata,   Drupada,   Dhrishtaketu   and \nSikhandin,  the  Panchala  prince.  I  long  to \nsee    the    dear    sons    of    Draupadi    and \nAbhimanyu.    I    do    not    see    them    here. \nWhere   are   they,   who   threw   their  bodies \ninto  the  blazing  fire  of  battle  for  my  sake,  \nlike  ghee  in  the  sacrifice?  I  do  not  see  any  \nof   them   here.   Where   are   they   all?   My \n\nplace  must  be  among  them.  At  the  close  of  \nthe  battle,  my  mother  Kunti  wanted  me  to  \noffer   libations   for   Karna   also.   When   I \nthink   of   it,   even   now,   grief   overwhelms \nme.   In   ignorance   of   his   being   my   own \nblood  brother,  I  caused  Karna  to  be  slain.  \nI  am  eager  to  see  him.  Bhima,  dearer  to \nme  than  life,  Arjuna,  who  was  like  Indra \nhim  self,  the  twins  Nakula  and  Sahadeva \nand     our     dear    Panchali,    steadfast    in \ndharma,  I  long  to  see  and  be  with  them  all.  \nI  do  not  wish  to  be  in  heaven,  for  what \ngood  is  it  for  me  to  be  here,  away  from \nmy  brothers?  Wherever  they  may  be,  that  \nme is swarga; not this place!\"  \nThe angels, who heard this, replied:  \n\"O   Yudhishthira,   if   you   indeed   desire   to \nbe  with  them,  by  all  means,  you  may  go  at  \nonce.  There  is  no  need  to  delay,\"  and  they  \nordered an attendant to take Yudhishthira.  \nSo,  the  messenger  proceeded  in  front  and  \nYudhishthira   followed   him.   As   they   went \nalong,   it   soon   became   dark   and   in   the \ngathering    gloom    could    be    dimly    seen \nthings weird and revolting.  \nHe  waded  through  slippery  slime  of  blood  \nand    offal.    The    path    was    strewn    with \ncarrion   and   bones   and   dead   men's   hair. \nWorms    were    wriggling    everywhere    and \nthere  was  an  insufferable  stench  in  the  air.  \nHe      saw      mutilated      human      bodies \neverywhere. \nYudhishthira   was   horrified   and   confused. \nA  thousand  thoughts  tortured  his  mind  as \nhe proceeded. \n\"How  far  have  we  to  go  yet  on  this  road?  \nWhere  indeed  are  my  brothers?  Tell  me, \nmy  friend,\"  he  enquired  of  the  messenger \nin deep anguish. \nThe  messenger  quietly  replied:  \"If  you  so \ndesire,  we  may  turn  back.\"  The  foul  odors  \nof  the  place  were  so  sickening  that  for  a \nmoment   Yudhishthira   was   minded   to   go \nback.  \nBut   just   then,   as   if   divining  his  intention, \nvaguely   familiar   voices   rose   all   around   in \nloud  lamentation.  \"O  Dharmaputra,  do  not \ngo  back!  Stay  here  for  a  few  minutes  at \nleast.     Your     presence     has     given     us \nmomentary   relief   from   torture.   As   you \ncame,  you  have  brought  with  you  a  whiff \nof   air   so   sweet   and   pure   that   we   have \nfound  a  little  relief  in  our  agony.  Son  of \nKunti,   the   very   sight   of   you   gives   us \ncomfort    and    mitigates    our    suffering.    O \nstay,  be  it  for  ever  so  short  a  time. Do  not  \ngo  back.  While  you  are  here,  we  enjoy  a  \nrespite   in our   torture.\"   Thus   the   voices \npleaded.  \nHearing   the   loud   lamentations   that   thus \ncame   from   all   around   him,   Yudhishthira \nstood         in         painful         bewilderment. \nOverwhelmed   with   pity   at   the   poignant \nanguish   in   faintly   remembered   voices,   he \nexclaimed:  \n\"Alas   wretched souls!   Who   are   ye   that \nlament like this? Why are you here?\" \n\"Lord, I am Karna,\" said a voice. \n\"I am Bhima,\" said another. \n\"I am Arjuna,\" cried a third voice. \n\"Draupadi,\"  cried  another  voice  in  piteous \ntone. \n\"I  am  Nakula,\"  \"I  am  Sahadeva,\"  \"We  are  \nDraupadi's    sons,\"    and    so    on,    came \nmournful   voices   from   all   around,   till   the \naccumulated      pain      was      more      that \nYudhishthira could bear. \n\"What   sin   indeed   have   these   been   guilty \nof?\"      cried      he.      \"Dhritarashtra's      son \nDuryodhana,  what  good  deeds  did  he  do \nto   sit   like   Mahendra   in   heaven,   while \nthese  are  in  hell?  Am  I  dreaming  or  am  I  \nawake?   Is   my   mind   deranged?   Have   I \ngone crazy?\" \nOverwhelmed     by     anger,     Yudhishthira \ncursed   the   gods   and   denounced   dharma. \nHe  turned  to  the  angel  attendant  and  said  \nsharply:  \"Go  back  to  your  masters.  I  shall  \nstay  here  where  my  dear  brothers,  for  no  \nother    sin    than    devotion    to    me,    are \nconsigned  to  the  tortures  of  hell.  Let  me \nbe with them.\"  \n\nThe   messenger   went   back   and   conveyed \nto Indra what Yudhishthira had said. \nThus  passed  the  thirteenth  part  of  a  day. \nThen   Indra   and   Yama   appeared   before \nYudhishthira   where   he   stood   in   anguish. \nWhen    they    came,    the    darkness    rolled \naway   and   the   horrid   sights   disappeared. \nThe   sinners   and   their   suffering   were   no \nmore  to  be  seen.  A  fragrant  breeze  blew  as  \nYama,  the  god  of dharma,  smiled  on  his \nson Yudhishthira.  \n\"Wisest   of   men,   this   is   the   third   time   I \nhave  tested  you.  You  chose  to  remain  in \nhell   for   the   sake   of   your   brothers.   It   is \ninevitable   that   kings   and   rulers   must   go \nthrough  hell  if  only  for  a  while.  So  it  was  \nthat  for  the  thirtieth  part  of  a  day  you  too  \nwere  doomed  to  suffer  the  pangs  of  hell. \nNeither        the        illustrious        Savyasachi \n(Arjuna)  nor  your  beloved  brother  Bhima \nis  really  in  hell.  Nor  Karna  the  just,  nor \nanyone   else   who   you   thought   had   been \nconsigned   to   suffering.   It   was   an   illusion \ndesigned  to  test  you.  This  is  not  hell,  but \nswarga.   Do   you   not   see   there   Narada \nwhose   travels   cover   the   three   worlds? \nCease grieving.\" \nThus   said   Yama   to   Dharmaputra,   who, \nthereupon,   was   transfigured.   The   mortal \nframe  was  gone  and  he  was  a  god.  With \nthe  disappearance  of  the  human  body,  also  \ndisappeared all trace of anger and hatred.  \nThen  Yudhishthira  saw  their  Karna  and  all \nhis  brothers  and  the  sons  of  Dhritarashtra \nalso,    serene    and    free    from    anger,    all \nhaving   attained   the   state   of   the gods.  In \nthis   reunion,   Yudhishthira   at   last   found \npeace and real happiness. \n\nGLOSSARY \n \nAbhimanyu : Son of Arjuna and Subhadra \nwho was married to Uttara, daughter of \nKing Virata. \nAcharya : Teacher or Guru. \nAchuta : A synonym of Sri Krishna. \nAdhiratha  : Karna's foster-father. \nAgastya  : A great sage whose life-story \nthe Pandavas learnt while on pilgrimage \nto holy places is wife Lopamudra was \nequally a great sage in her own right. \nAgnihotra : A sacrifice to God Agni. \nAiravata  : Indra's elephant. \nAjatasatru  : Having no enemy, friend of \nall born things, an epithet of Yudhishthira. \nAkshayapatra :  A wonderful vessel given \nto Yudhishthira by the Sun god which \nheld a never-failing supply of food. \nAlambasa  : A Rakshasa friend of \nDuryodhana who had joined his forces but \nSatyaki compelled him to flee from the \nbattlefield. \nAmrit :  Ambrosia, the food of the gods, \nwhich makes the partaker immortal. \nAnga  : Mlechchha kings, a Kaurava \nsupporter. \nArani :  An upper and a lower piece of \nwood used for producing fire by attrition. \nArtha (Wealth) : one of the objects of \nhuman life, the others being Dharma, \n(righteous- ness), Kama (satisfaction of \ndesires), Moksha (spiritual salvation). \nArundhati :  Wife of sage Vasishtha. \nAshtavakra : A towering scholar while \nstill in his teens. \nAsita :  A sage who held that gambling \nwas ruinous and should be avoided by all \nwise people. \nAsmaka  : A Kaurava warrior who \nattacked Abhimanyu. \nAstra :  A missile charged with power by \na holy incantation. \nAswamedha Yajna  : A horse sacrifice. \nAswathama :  Son of Dronacharya and \nlast supreme commander of the Kaurava \nforce. \nBahlika, Dasharna, : States the kings of \nwhich were Kalinga, Magadha, friendly to \nthe Pandavas, Matsya, Panchala, Salva \nBaladev  : Balarama, elder brother of Sri \nKrishna. \nBalarama  : Elder brother of Sri Krishna. \nBalarama  : An avatar or incarnation of \nAdisesha the thousand-hooded serpent on \nwhich Lord Mahavishnu reclines in \nVaikuntha. \nBakasura  : A voracious, cruel and terribly \nstrong Rakshasa or demon who lived in a \ncave near the city  of Ekachakrapura \nwhom Bhima killed to the great relief of \nthe citizens. \nBhagadatta  : King of Pragjyotisha, a \nKaurava ally. \nBhagawan :  Form of address to Gods and \ngreat rishis, example- Bhagawan Sri \nKrishna, Narada,  Vyasa.  \nBharata : Son of Kaikeyi and King \nDashratha, stepbrother of Rama, who was \nexceptionally devoted to and loved Rama. \nBharadwaja :  A rishi, father of \nYavakrida. \nBrahma :  Creator of the universe. \nBrahmastra :  A divine weapon, \nirresistible, one given by Lord Brahma \nhimself. \nBrahmacharin  : A religious student, \nunmarried, who lives with his spiritual \nguide, devoted to study and service. \nBrahmacharya : Celibacy, chastity; the \nstage of life of Vedic study in which \nchastity and service are essential. \nBrihadaswa  : A great sage who visited \nthe Pandavas in their forest hermitage and \nreminded them of King Nala of Nishadha \nwho also lost his kingdom in the game of \ndice and who deserted his wife Damayanti \nbecause of a curse but ultimately regained \nboth, \n\nBrihadratha : Commander of three \nregiments reigned over Magadha and \nattained celebrity as a great hero, married \nthe twin daughters of the Raja of Kasi.
